9000.0000 0 7900  Mr. President, ever since I had the honor of drafting the report on combating HIV-AIDS within the EU and neighboring countries,
10000.0000 8020 9660  I have been very committed to this
12000.0000 9660 11040  issue with all its
13000.0000 11040 11640  implications
14000.0000 11640 12940  and ramifications for
