# Low-Latency Speech Translation
Low-latency speech translation, also known as simultaneous speech translation is a speech translation which occurs in real-time. The input is an audio in the source language and the output is a written text in the target language. To realise the low-latency ability, a method called "Incremental Decoding" is used. This method suggest segmentation of the input data into small fixed-size chunks. In each step, chunk-level inputs are given to the model incrementally and decoded by the model to generate a partial output. A certain part of this output is selected and committed not to be modified again. The next step's decoding is conditioned on the committed outputs so far. More information about the incremental decoding and different strategies to select committed outputs can be found in this [article] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11185).
