The recent Russian-Ukrainian crisis has clearly demonstrated existing problems in the energy sector, and especially the total dependence of some Member States on single suppliers of natural gas.
The Baltic countries, which are isolated from the rest of Europe, are left to the mercy of gas suppliers from eastern Europe.
Now it is more important than ever to develop a comprehensive common energy policy based on solidarity, the diversification of energy sources and defence of common interests.
I would like take this opportunity to thank the Commission and especially the Swedish Presidency for presenting the Baltic Sea Strategy, which will allow effective mobilisation of structural funds to be used more efficiently to achieve common goals.
I am convinced that, if properly implemented, the strategy will become an example of regional success.
Finally I would like to urge the Commission to take a leading role in the implementation of the Baltic Sea Strategy in order to ensure that in certain cases the interests of individual Member States do not take precedence over the achievement of common strategy goals.
Mr President, energy security is for us to a large extent a question of energy independence, as many have said, and, as Mr Piebalgs said correctly, the most effective strategy is that of efficiency, savings and renewables.
But we, as Greens, are also realistic and realise that, in the medium term, we will need gas supplies.
Therefore, we are in favour of diversification and also see the Nabucco project as a European priority project.
But let me say why we do not believe that a nuclear strategy is a strategy of independence, certainly not of energy independence.
After all, uranium is imported, and not only from countries we like.
And, if we speak about security, we have to mention the security implications of nuclear energy, namely nuclear proliferation, and we see the problems that we have with that in other very high-profile security issues.
We cannot neglect that, and we cannot say that nuclear energy is completely separate from the question of nuclear proliferation.
In addition, our group strongly believes that all projects have to address concerns about transparency and corruption and cannot stand in the way of a frank and strict human rights dialogue with the cooperation countries, as well as a holistic and political approach to these countries.
Madam President, we would like to introduce the following oral amendment to Amendment 13: ‘ Urges the development of country-by-country reporting that provides a comprehensive
view of each parent company of a group for investors, stakeholders and tax authorities, thereby facilitating a more effective and transparent international overview of tax-led decisions ’.
Madam President, I voted for the resolution.
I am glad to see that both Europe and the most powerful countries do not underestimate the seriousness of the situation we are all in and are not looking for a ‘ one size fits all ’ approach.
The crisis has been caused by a number of complex and interrelated factors, and there will be no easy way out.
The global financial crisis also gave us a good opportunity to reconsider our priorities and actions, especially in the long-term management of sustainable economic recovery.
We have commitments to and expectations from our citizens to get our economies moving again at full speed with a view to ensuring the effective functioning of capital markets and lending, tackling unemployment and creating jobs, and protecting our people, especially the poorest and most vulnerable.
This is not going to be easy, but I believe that we are moving in the right direction.
Madam President, I will be focusing my comments on the Commission budget and I would like to congratulate Mr Surján for everything he has done as the general rapporteur
but, in the absence of the coordinator of our group, Mr Bokros, who happens to be in Hungary for a long-term engagement that he was committed to, I am asked to present the group ’ s position today.
I understand that this is the third different group that I have presented views for in this House since I have been a Member – not that I have changed, just the groups have.
So the three points I would like to make in the debate today are as follows. Firstly, the general situation is a serious one, which has already been indicated in a financial and economic manner.
Our deficit levels are at historic highs in several Member States, as the President of the Council has indicated.
Indeed, in some Member States, the debate is not about where the money is going to be contributed but about the levels of cuts which will be needed to bring the expenditure back into line, as it is in my own country.
Therefore this is a very mixed debate on how we are going to make sure we can make the European Union run effectively.
Here, however, we will be looking at the budget.
In terms of the budget that we will be preparing for 2010, it is a budget which obviously is at the beginning.
We are in our opening gambits, but in our group, we will be looking very clearly at the quality of expenditure – as the Commissioner has said, on expenditure where monies can be reasonably executed and not being in any way excessive in this regard because of the general situation we find ourselves in.
My last comment relates to the comments made by our Chair in the Committee on Budgets, Alain Lamassoure.
We must use this occasion – it is the first year of a five-year Parliament – to look ahead.
We must discover, if we can, from the Commission when we are going to get the mid-term review, how it will be shaped, how we are going to be able to look ahead, not just to the mid-term review, but how we are going to approach future financial perspectives, as Mr Böge laid out in his report in the last Parliament.
Not least, how we begin to set in train an interinstitutional process that will look at long-term trends and that will enable us to get the right budgetary analysis, because without that, it is really difficult to plan ahead.
Madam President, I agree with those speakers who said we have a real opportunity in front of us with a new US Administration in place.
Three quick points.
Firstly, we seem to have evolved into a situation where we have a huge number of subjects which are discussed between the EU and the US, but no strategic dialogue, and yet they tell me in Washington that the US and China have a much greater strategic dialogue than between us across the Atlantic.
Is it not time at this summit to say that we want a strategic dialogue for a strategic partnership?
Secondly, regarding the point on protectionism on the TEC, it is quite clear that the biggest danger in the next 12 months is closing markets rather than opening ones, and yet we have the transatlantic market which is, as Mr Brok said, the biggest opportunity we have for generating growth on both sides of the Atlantic.
Is it not time to make the transatlantic market a major part of trade development, rather than putting it to one side as a regulatory issue?
It is actually a major opener. Lastly, it is disappointing that we have no study and no road map as promised by Mr Verheugen.
The study was paid for by Parliament.
If you want Parliament to cooperate on saying how we now need to see how to open markets, please release this report, as the resolution says, by 15 November.
Madam President, I congratulate and thank my colleague Alexander Alvaro for his work and for the good cooperation we had during the drafting of this report.
It was a report where I agreed with the rapporteur on the main points, namely that access to the data entered into the customs information system is to be ensured only to specifically designated bodies and staff like the Member States, Europol and Eurojust.
Another point which was raised in one of my amendments and supported by the rapporteur refers to the fact that Member States, Europol and Eurojust are not
granted the possibility to communicate data to non-Member States and third countries because of the absence of sufficient data protection in those countries.
In my opinion, the review of the customs information system as reflected by the report is necessary in order to adapt it better to the control
services ’ requirements and to allow a limited number of users to carry out analyses of the information contained in the system.
The review will also increase the effectiveness of the cooperation and control procedures of the customs administrations due to the joint,
automated information system which will assist in preventing, investigating and prosecuting serious contraventions of national laws.
Madam President, I have the honour to present to Parliament the report of the Committee on International Trade on macro-financial assistance (MFA) to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
As with other countries to which the Commission has proposed to give MFA, the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been seriously affected by the current economic and financial crisis.
Its economy is in a serious situation and it is clear that a way out of this crisis must be found.
Therefore, Bosnia and Herzegovina has applied for EU assistance and the Commission has proposed to provide it in the form of a loan amounting to up to EUR 100 million, which is to be made available in two instalments during 2010.
Now we have to decide whether we support this request or not.
Under the current treaty rules, we are merely consulted.
Therefore, on the one hand, one could argue: why not wait for the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force and handle a modified proposal already under the ordinary legislative procedure?
On the other hand, despite the increasing importance of our work after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, I believe that we, as a Parliament, must show responsibility and political commitment and do
our part in giving this Balkan country, early next year already, the assistance it needs now, rather than discussing it at length and being able to give the assistance only at some unknown point of time in the future.
For the above reasons, the suggestion of the Committee on International Trade is to have the proposal of MFA to Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon without amendments under the simplified procedure.
My colleagues on our committee supported this proposal unanimously and now I ask for the support of the whole House as well.
Madam President, all four countries to which the Commission has today proposed to give macro-financial assistance have been seriously affected by the current economic and financial crisis.
Their economies are in a serious situation, and it is clear that a way out from this crisis must be found.
In the case of Georgia, the proposed macro-financial assistance of EUR 46 million in the form of grant instalments is aimed at supporting Georgia ’ s recovery after that country experienced a severe economic downturn following the eruption of the military conflict with Russia and the global financial crisis.
The EUR 100 million for Armenia is forecast to have an immediate impact on Armenia ’ s balance of payments, and would in this way contribute to the alleviation of financial constraints on the implementation of the authorities ’ economic programme and to financing the budget deficit.
Serbia, however badly affected by the financial and economic crisis, is rapidly returning to political stability.
As a Balkan country, it is a potential candidate country for EU membership and has signed a stabilisation and association agreement.
For this reason, it should also be helped.
Politically speaking, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a potential candidate country which has also signed a stabilisation and association agreement, and it is in the interests of the European Union to assist it.
To conclude, I restate my belief that we as the European Parliament must show responsibility and political commitment in giving these countries the macro-financial assistance they need now, rather than discussing this at length under the ordinary legislative procedure.
For the above reasons, on behalf of the PPE Group, I suggest we have the proposal for macro-financial assistance to these countries adopted now.
I ask my colleagues to support it unanimously.
Mr President, this is a very important issue and I voted for this resolution because I believe that we need to have a piece of legislation protecting our citizens in case of airline bankruptcies.
Millions of our citizens use low-cost airlines every day.
However, the high number of low-cost airline bankruptcies in the European Union since 2000, and the recent case of Sky Europe, have clearly demonstrated the vulnerability of the low-cost carriers to the changing oil prices and the current difficult economic conditions.
We must rectify this situation, and we ask the Commission to consider the most adequate compensation measures for our passengers.
Mr President, I think that the recent European Union position led by the Swedish Presidency on the Middle East that would recognise East
Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent Palestinian state may harm European efforts to play a significant part in mediating between Israel and the Palestinians.
It might be counterproductive with our common objective to bring peace to this already turbulent region.
I personally believe that rather than unilaterally and unexpectedly announcing an independent capital for the Palestinian territories, it would be preferable and more useful
if the European Union would concentrate all its efforts on encouraging and pushing for the creation of a real democracy in the Palestinian territories, for example, supporting non-violent opposition.
This would help the Israeli state and democracy, as well as the international community, to find a credible and legitimate interlocutor.
As Cecilia Malmström has said today, the status of Jerusalem should be negotiated bilaterally by Israelis and Palestinians.
I therefore believe that rather than a ‘ two states for two peoples ’ solution, a ‘ two democracies for two peoples ’ vision would be more desirable.
Democracy, dear colleagues, is a precondition for peace.
Mr President, before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the three proposals in question were based on Articles 60, 301 and 308 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
This is now only of historical interest, since the legal basis has changed and we have to refer to Articles 215 and 75 of the new treaty.
Incredible as it might seem, the Lisbon Treaty limited the role of the European Parliament in this particular case.
Article 215 clearly states that the Council only has to inform the European Parliament on the measures adopted, as opposed to the former procedure that implied the consultation of Parliament on such matters.
I cannot accept that, and I strongly support my colleagues ’ initiative to clarify Parliament ’ s involvement in this area.
Leaving aside the legal aspect that I hope will be solved through good cooperation between the European institutions, I would like to draw your attention to the important
problem that we are debating here, which is fighting terrorism and terrorism-related activities, such as the ones carried out by Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaeda network.
I think that when it comes to such sensitive topics, we cannot afford to classify them into strict categories such as EU-internal and
EU-external issues, because terrorist actions might be planned outside the EU but can seriously affect the people living inside the EU.
We have the responsibility to protect these European citizens against terrorist action, so we have to be given the tools to do that.
I trust your good judgment in solving this procedural problem, and I am looking forward to hearing the opinion of the representatives of the Council and the Commission.
Mr President, at the beginning of this week ’ s part-session, you answered a question from my Austrian colleague, Jörg Leichtfried, on the new Members joining this Parliament as a result of the Lisbon Treaty and when that could take place.
You answered that this is now up to the Council.
I agree as regards them joining this Parliament as full Members, but I am not sure that this is the case when it comes to their status as observers as an introduction to actually becoming full Members.
I interpret the decision we took recently on David Martin ’ s report on our own internal rules so that we are actually free to let them start working as observers as soon as they are elected and their election confirmed by their Member State, and that we as a parliament can decide ourselves on the conditions for their position as observers.
Mr President, could you please discuss this with the rapporteur, Mr Martin, in order to come to a solution as soon as possible?
It would be unreasonable if new Members who are already elected and whose election has been confirmed by the national authorities have to wait for months and months before they can actually start working.
Many of them are prepared to start immediately.
Mr President, ‘ let us not allow fear to guide us ’, we often say.
Some people question whether our airport security measures are too tight.
Well, the Detroit terror attempt made us realise that our security systems are not excessively tight, but are still rather unsatisfactory.
As you all know, the Slovakian secret service placed plastic explosives in the bag of a Slovakian citizen.
The passenger, as well as the bag, got on board without any problems and landed in Ireland.
No doubt the test was spectacular, but certainly it did not strengthen the belief of citizens that security, on the one hand, and the right to privacy, on the other hand, are taken seriously by the authorities.
Citizens are flooded with conflicting information and misinterpretations in the press on a daily basis.
After Detroit, to give you an example, the spotlight is on body scanners as the best solution.
Mr President, I think it is clear to all of us here that the Iranian regime is a dictatorial and criminal regime.
The question is: how to deal with it?
I would like to state very clearly my support for the delegation that would have gone to Iran from this Parliament.
The delegation would have met, for one whole day, members of the opposition and dissidents.
It would have strengthened them.
They wanted that.
So I really feel very sorry that this delegation visit could not take place.
I have one very concrete question to you, Baroness Ashton.
Several Members here have talked about sanctions.
From the experience I have as a member of the national parliament and talking with many people for a long time, I would really be in favour of smart sanctions – targeted, for example, at specific members of the Revolutionary Guard, putting them on a veto list for visits, or at other specific persons.
I am very much against imposing sanctions on the whole country as that would probably strengthen the government, because then poverty would increase – they would not have access, for example, to petrol – and that would help to support the regime instead of weakening it.
Madam President, I very much welcome the efforts of my colleagues insisting on a strategy for the Danube Region.
Coming from Lithuania, I am very well aware that Member States alone are unable to achieve significant progress in terms of economic development, environmental protection, sustainable transport and tourism, energy and many other areas.
I am positive that regional strategies can be more effective and should be promoted because Member States are then acting in the common interest.
I wish my colleagues the determination to achieve their goals and I believe that their voice will be heard by the new Commission, especially because sustainable regional development is among the top priorities on the Commission ’ s agenda.
Mr President, we would like to replace the sentence in paragraph 6 which reads: ‘ to release all disappeared who are still in captivity ’.
Instead we would like to introduce: ‘ to make every effort to ensure that all who have been abducted are safety returned to their families ’.
Mr President, this amendment refers to the fact that the government in Skopje has come forward with a draft anti-discrimination law deleting sexual orientation from that whole package.
That is simply unacceptable, but I do not want to give anybody the option to vote against this amendment on human rights because of the name issue with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, so I ask to change ‘ Macedonian Government ’ to ‘ Government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ’.
Mr President, I supported this report because I believe that it represents a step forward in combating fraud and tax evasion on a European scale.
Despite the willingness of Member States to cooperate in the field of taxation, tangible results have not been achieved, and tax fraud remains at an extremely high level in the EU and brings far too many negative implications both to our economies and our citizens.
I very much welcome the proposed new improvements, which will hopefully produce tangible results in the fight against fraud and tax evasion, especially the extension of the scope
of the directive on all taxes, including social security contributions, the automatic exchange of information and improved cooperation between the Member States in matters of taxation.
Mr President, I shall start by saying that I, too, support a strong, outward-looking EU that is capable of acting shoulder to shoulder as a true counterpart to the US, and in that framework, I think it is of crucial importance to be
open, fair and transparent if we are to address the issue of how Europe should cooperate with the US for counter-terrorism purposes, including law-enforcement use of data collected for commercial ends.
Without a doubt, the targeted exchange and use of data for counter-terrorism purposes is, and will remain, necessary, but let me be clear: European citizens must be able to trust both security and data claims.
Getting it right first time round should be the objective and, with all due respect, the Council has been insufficiently strong to do so.
Indeed, the proposed interim agreement is a significant departure from European law in how enforcement agencies would obtain financial records of individuals, namely through
court-approved warrants or subpoenas to examine specific transactions, but with the proposed interim agreement, we instead rely on broad administrative subpoenas for millions of records of European citizens.
By the very nature of SWIFT, it is not possible to refer to the so-called ‘ limited ’ requests.
For technical reasons, SWIFT has to transfer bulk data, thereby violating the basic principles of EU data-protection law such as necessity and proportionality.
This cannot be rectified by mechanisms of oversight and control.
At all times, it must be clear that Parliament is not out there to just passively take note of the actions of the Council and the Commission.
The fact is that this House is always being promised jam tomorrow if only we would be patient.
However, we cannot keep falling for fake promises of jam tomorrow.
We need clear commitments now and the ball was in the Council ’ s court.
I made that clear last week, but so far, it has failed to act accordingly.
The Council states that it wants to ensure the utmost respect for privacy and data, but fails to address in particular the rights of access, rectification, compensation and redress outside the EU for data subjects.
The Council states that it shares Parliament ’ s concerns and therefore calls on the Commission to adopt draft negotiation guidelines.
Why hide behind the Commission?
It is Council that will adopt the negotiation directives in the end; why have the negotiation guidelines not already been submitted?
Council states yet again that it wants to ensure that the TFTP will continue.
However, it fails to address the fact that in this way, the EU continues to outsource its financial intelligence service to the US.
The lack of reciprocity is not being addressed.
True reciprocity would allow the EU authorities to obtain similar data stored in the US and, in the long term, consider the necessity of building up our own EU capacity.
The Council does not show any commitment to line up with existing legislation such as the data retention directive for the telecom service providers, which does deal with specific and targeted data.
The Council fails to clarify the precise role of the public authority.
A ‘ push ’ system does not mean anything if, in actual practice, SWIFT has to transfer bulk data.
Transfer and storage are, in other words, by definition disproportionate under the terms of the interim agreement and the Council does not address a European solution for the supervision of data exchange.
President-in-Office, tell me how on earth I can tell 500 million European citizens that we are selling out on important safeguards and principles just because we are not able to put our foot down, because Council is not able to get its act together.
Tell me; I am all ears.
Mr President, a simple letter from the Council that the negotiation guidelines will fully contain Parliament ’ s concerns, that negotiations will begin immediately with the United States and not at some point in the
future, and that Parliament will be fully involved in these negotiations might have sufficed, and it would not be that difficult to give in order to alleviate this Parliament ’ s concerns about the way it has been treated, ignored and played with in the past.
But you could not do even this today.
The bulk transfer of data, the Commissioner said, is not a problem.
Only some data will go there.
SWIFT tells us that is not the case.
The United States administration tells us that is not the case.
There is no proof of what you say in this statement.
You mentioned the negotiating guidelines that you are nearly done with.
Where are they?
Given the pressure that exists today, why can you not tell us exactly where you agree and where you disagree with Parliament, instead of making general statements?
I feel it is extremely important to fight together with the United States against terrorism.
I urge the United States and Council to work very seriously together with us after our vote tomorrow, and not to choose bilateral routes or dream about breaking the solidarity, but to work together to protect fundamental rights while we protect security.
Mr President, is the Council aware of the fact that in the past years, SWIFT has never once transmitted specific data because it cannot extract it, and always transfers bulk data?
Is the Council aware of the fact that, precisely because of that, there is an agreement between the US and SWIFT that stations SWIFT personnel in the Treasury Department in order to ensure that the bulk data the Treasury gets does not get searched in a bulk manner?
Is the Council aware of the fact that the interim agreement does not include even the slightest concession to Parliament?
If I am right – which I hope I am – are the Council and the Commission committed to taking the bulk data issue extremely seriously in the mandate of the negotiations?
Madam President, I am going to put the question on behalf of my committee, the Committee on International Trade, and as the chair of this committee.
The effects of the crisis on world trade indicate a possible 10% decline in 2009.
This represents the biggest such contraction since the Second World War brought on by the collapse in global demand.
Keeping international trade flowing is vital for the EU and other exports-oriented countries.
Despite commitments made by the G20, trade restrictive and distortive measures in response to the crisis have increased within the G20, as well as globally.
The first sub-question is: what steps have been taken by the Commission to tackle such measures and, conversely, have any steps been taken by third countries against any other EU measures to boost economic growth?
The second sub-question: there are indicators that some of the emerging countries that have been less affected by the crisis are becoming drivers of growth in international trade.
In this case, EU industry needs to retarget its export markets and possibly the future of its products.
What strategy does the Commission intend to pursue to enable EU industry to become more competitive?
Third sub-question: the global crisis and subsequent fall in world trade are having multiple effects on developing countries where the most unemployment is concentrated.
What adjustment measures does the Commission plan to take in its trade relations in particular for the poorest countries in the world?
Fourth point: while, on the one hand, large trade deficits are driven by excessive spending and indebtedness in some Member
States, including the United States of America, on the other hand, large export-driven economies in certain emerging countries are experiencing trade surpluses.
These trade deficits have contributed to global imbalances that are at the root of the global economic crisis.
What strategy does the Commission intend to pursue to mitigate such global imbalances in its trade policy?
Fifth and last point: the social impact of the economic crisis and the subsequent fall in world trade are set to outlast economic recovery.
For example, we are seeing signs of economic recovery now, but levels of unemployment remain very high.
When does the Commission plan to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of the crisis on jobs in Europe and in the developing countries?
What strategy does it intend to pursue to incorporate the social and environmental dimension of trade into international WTO rules?
These are the five points that the Committee on International Trade would like to address to the new Trade Commissioner
Mr De Gucht, whom I welcome to the floor for the first public exchange of views with Parliament and the members of the INTA Committee, in particular.
Thank you in advance for the answers that I am sure you will be able to give to the questions that we are putting to you.
Mr President, during the last few months, the EU has experienced several changes and transitions.
We have had three Commissioners on International Trade, two EU Council Presidents and the Lisbon Treaty.
During that time, I argued with all the top officials about the need to fine-tune the South Korea-EU FTA, so as to get on board deeply dissatisfied industries, particularly the EU automotive industry.
The strongest arguments were mainly in the area of DDB safeguards and non-tariff barriers.
When the new Commissioner, in response to my question during the hearings, stated that DDB deserved a closer look, I felt optimistic.
Even the USA has shelved its FTA with South Korea partly because of similar objections from the car industry.
This is the first major FTA.
This is a template.
We need to do it right.
There must be a level playing field for both parties.
Please do not get me wrong.
I am a strong proponent of FTAs.
I understand their positive impact on GDP and employment, but we should also understand that, when the competitive advantage is one-sided, benefits will diminish and, in the worst case, could even be negative.
Employees in the EU deserve better.
Perhaps we should turn to our transatlantic partner and together demand small adjustments which would at least partially satisfy these giant industries and get new FTAs to work as soon as possible.
There will always be some unsatisfied elements but, all in all, FTAs must be beneficial to citizens of both sides.
It is my responsibility to monitor the situation and ensure that my constituents, and EU citizens, get a fair deal.
Mr President, the proposal of a free trade agreement between the European Union and South Korea has been considered unfair and unbalanced by the Catalan and the European car industry.
This industry and also the European textile sector have expressed concerns on specific issues such as the duty drawback system and the safeguard clause.
Also, the European Trade Unions Federation has criticised this free trade agreement.
South Korea has not ratified any of the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organisation.
South Korea persists in repressing trade union rights.
Moreover, we are aware that, for this free trade agreement with South Korea, there was a clear division among the European Commission college and also among the European Commission services, in particular, between DG Taxation and Customs Union and DG Trade, on the duty drawback system.
As far as the DG Taxation and Customs Union is concerned, the duty drawback system creates economic distortion as it is actually an export subsidy.
This should create a clear competitive advantage against European industry in favour of Korean industry in the European Union.
The same Korean trade investment promotion agency has calculated this advantage as at least EUR 1 300 per car.
Therefore, does the new Commission consider this free trade agreement a fair trade agreement?
Will the new Commission provide Parliament with a full, up-to-date impact assessment and analyses about this duty drawback system?
Mr President, the Goldstone report tries to fulfil the mandate it was given.
That mandate is, or was, the following: ‘ To investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that might have been committed at any time in the
context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza during the period from 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, whether before, during or after.
’ And that is exactly what the Goldstone report has done – although it was not just Mr Goldstone, it was also his two female colleagues.
They conducted investigations on what happened in Gaza and came up with conclusions that are disturbing to say the least.
They are extremely disturbing because they find in most of the instances they looked into that breaches of international law and international humanitarian law
and breaches of the Geneva Conventions have indeed been committed by the forces of a state that claims to be the sole democratic state in the region.
That is indeed very disquieting.
We should not let it pass.
So when we are called upon to take a position on this report, the question is not whether we are for or against Israel, for or against the Palestinians, for or against Hamas; the
question is whether we condone breaches of international law, of international humanitarian law and of the Geneva Conventions, no matter by whom they were committed.
That is what we need to answer.
Mr President, here in the European Parliament, we recently adopted a resolution on Ukraine in which we questioned the granting
by the former President of Ukraine of a high state award to Stepan Bandera, a leader of the struggle for the country ’ s independence.
This paragraph in our resolution has attracted much criticism in western Ukraine.
I would like to say that this resolution did not question Bandera ’ s goal of an independent Ukraine.
Indeed, the resolution supported the cause of a strong, united and free Ukraine, which has the full backing of the European Union and my native Poland, but
the resolution did suggest regret that the award was given with little regard to the tragic circumstances of the wartime struggle for an independent Ukraine.
This saw ethnic cleansing carried out also in the name of Bandera.
My view is that what was missing from the award given to Bandera was an expression of regret for innocent victims of the struggle.
Only then could it have fully served the goal of an independent Ukraine in peace with its neighbours.
The award should have been accompanied by an effort for reconciliation with the families.
Mr President, I would just like to comment on the third point of the oral question this evening on airline bankruptcy.
A recent resolution in this House called for the establishment of a guarantee fund that would be used to compensate passengers in case of airline bankruptcy.
However, the establishment of such a fund would inevitably have to be funded by the consumer, meaning passengers would be required to pay even more for their tickets.
At this stage, this is an unnecessary step and would add to the sizeable list of existing airport taxes, security charges and other duties that they are already forced to pay.
In addition, the Commission should ensure that the national aviation authorities and regulators uphold existing obligations, such as regularly carrying out financial status checks of airlines and exercising their right to revoke airline operating licences before liquidation occurs.
We ask the Commission to vigorously pursue this course of action now.
Finally, I would call on the Commission to pursue other options which could protect passengers in this regard, including the provision of obligatory information regarding risk, insurance options and other protective mechanisms.
Madam President, I supported this report.
Effective consumer enforcement policy is central to the functioning of the single market.
We need to have a real and well-functioning internal market with a high level of consumer protection, which, unfortunately, is not the case today.
We have the legislation in place, but it is not enforced properly in the Member States.
Most importantly, our consumers do not feel safe because they do not know the rules and, in many cases, the compensation mechanisms are not working in the way they should.
The Commission should increase its efforts, ensuring that Member States apply directives correctly and that citizens are informed about their rights and, most importantly, that they are able to exercise those rights in practice.
Mr President, one of the key issues in the new Lisbon Treaty is the increased role of the European Union in the world.
With this new strengthened foreign policy, we as a Union must be more active in the promotion and defence of human rights and fundamental rights in third countries.
What are you and Mrs Ashton planning to do to strengthen the EU ’ s policy on the promotion of democracy?
Secondly, will you be supporting greater funding for the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights in the next budget?
Human rights always seem to take second and third place in our dialogues.
I think we need to spend more time and money on the promotion of democracy and build a true European endowment for democracy.
I would like to hear your opinion on these issues.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the Commission on finally having achieved what EU leaders have been talking about for decades.
They have actually managed to get ordinary citizens interested in EU politics.
ACTA is an issue that people on the net really care about.
But, having said that, I still feel I must criticise the Commission for the method it has used.
The reason so many citizens are following the ACTA issue is because they are furious.
They are furious at proposals to limit their freedom and invade their privacy just because some big companies are asking for it.
They are furious because they see their fundamental civil liberties balanced against industry interests and coming up short.
They are furious at the complete lack of transparency.
This is not how it should be in a democracy.
Tomorrow, we will be voting on a resolution that calls on the Commission to live up to the treaty and put all ACTA papers on the table.
I hope the resolution will be adopted by an overwhelming majority.
The right to privacy, to information freedom and to fair and proper trial are the cornerstones of a free and open society.
Tomorrow, we will show that this is a parliament that is prepared to stand up for those rights in the information age.
We will demand the information that is both our right and our due as the elected representatives, and we will respectfully remind the Commission that this is Parliament, not a doormat.
Madam President, the question was submitted by Brian Simpson, on behalf of Parliament ’ s Committee on Transport and Tourism, following the Commission ’ s report looking into the effectiveness of the EU blacklist.
Four years on, we know that the blacklist has proved an effective and valuable tool in promoting enforcement of ICAO safety standards and in protecting EU citizens.
How we can now build on this is the question facing us today.
In other words, how can we extend the protection beyond our own borders and further work towards the goal of improving global aviation security?
The blacklist has a responsibility not only to identify where the safety risks lie but also to ensure that this information is effectively communicated to EU citizens.
In line with this, how can we ensure that EU citizens taking flights outside Europe are aware of banned air carriers that continue operating in other regions of the world?
In cases where the air carrier ’ s licence has been revoked, and therefore the air carrier does not appear on the blacklist, how can we be sure that passengers are aware of this situation?
We have seen how effective the bringing together of different national blacklists into one comprehensive EU-wide list has been.
However, the blacklist is only as good as the access we have to information relating to the safety of air carriers.
How can we build on the information which forms the basis of the blacklist by improving the access to verifiable and reliable information?
This means not only looking at strengthening the checks made in EU Member States but also approving the data information received from non-EU Member States.
Would the Commission consider establishing harmonised and standardised ramp checks and reporting?
In terms of improving the data information received from third countries, would the Commission consider establishing an effective system of international exchange of reliable data, bringing us closer to a kind of worldwide blacklist which I know has been mooted in the past?
Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that the blacklist has proved an effective tool in incentivising airlines to meet international safety standards.
But how can we work more proactively towards the ultimate goal of improving global aviation safety?
By this I mean, how does the Commission intend to support national civil aviation authorities in meeting safety deficits based on ICAO audits and improving their oversight capability?
It is crucial that we ensure effective communication channels with the public, but it is also vitally important that, in the long term, we continue to work on promoting the enforcement of international aviation safety standards around the world.
This will ultimately be the most effective way of improving safety for all passengers.
The Committee on Transport and Tourism of the European Parliament looks forward to working with the Commission to try and build on the EU ’ s blacklist achievements.
Mr President, last week ’ s riots have led Kyrgyzstan into a political, judicial and economic crisis.
Its constitutional court was practically disbanded and the interim government ’ s actions appear uncoordinated.
Meanwhile, the brother of Kurmanbek Bakiyev has announced that the hand-written resignation statement is a fake and that Bakiyev did not himself resign.
According to eye-witnesses, new local groups trying to take over regional governments have emerged.
Similarly, ethnic-based groupings appear, creating fear of more ethnic violence.
Criminal groups operate freely in the country.
Large numbers of weapons are being circulated and robberies are taking place.
Safety, security and the interests of the EU citizens in this country are still endangered.
The present interim government is unable to counter any of these threats.
The situation is completely unclear for the local people.
High Representative Ashton has issued two statements expressing her concern, but more active and practical actions are urgently needed instead.
It is important that the EU take a decisive position on the situation in Kyrgyzstan in this strategically important country.
We need to be more present there, cooperating with the UN, USA and OSCE to defend the interests of Kyrgyzstani and EU citizens who are currently unable to protect their lives and defend their property.
It is clear that the EU should pursue an independent investigation into the causes and effects of the riots.
About the material resources of the Kyrgyz Bank and the agency for investment and development: they need to be evaluated before assigning any further financial assistance.
Inactivity and hesitancy on the EU ’ s part and an absence of real strategy and tactics may lead to very dangerous developments and undermine the EU ’ s own economic and political interests and credibility in the region and in the rest of the world.
Mr President, within the EU in 2008 the EIB reacted swiftly and accurately to the financial crisis by increasing its capital and almost doubling investments and disbursements compared to previous years, and in particular towards SMEs.
However, under the EIB ’ s external mandate, this sense of urgency for counter-cyclical action has not been shown by the EIB in developing countries.
The EIB even decreased its investment significantly in ACP countries, in Asia and in Latin America.
The annual report painfully shows that, for developing countries, the EIB ’ s response to the crisis has been far too slow.
The main task of the EIB as a public institution in developing countries should not only be to invest in heavy infrastructure; another and equally important task is providing capital in times of scarcity, supporting markets where private banks are reluctant.
Under the external mandate the EIB should invest more in financial services, offering better access to loans and savings for citizens and SMEs.
That leads to sustainable growth here and in developing countries.
Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon recognises the importance of the availability and accessibility of social services and the roles played by local and regional authorities in providing these.
The issues of social housing are of extreme importance to people with low incomes, and it is a reality that the crisis has left a large number of people unemployed, who are in need of social housing.
Currently, Member States apply different standards when deciding their criteria for social housing.
It is understandable that the economic and social situations differ significantly in the Member States.
In order to implement the right of access to universal services, I believe it would be reasonable to define general principles and to set the recommended upper income limit at EU level.
However, we need to allow broad discretion for the Member States to make this lower, taking into account economic and social differences.
Madam President, we are all aware of the horrendous disruption caused, and continuing to be caused, by the volcanic ash cloud.
More than 100 000 flights have been cancelled and around 12 million passengers have not been able to travel as planned.
Goods and cargo have been delayed or not transported at all and businesses, both large and small, have been affected.
Our European airlines and airports have suffered catastrophic financial losses.
I believe that European airlines alone have lost more than EUR 2 billion.
In all this chaos, one thing is clear: air transport is enormously important for the European economy, and as individuals, we depend on a thriving and efficient air transport industry where safety for crew and passengers is the first prerogative.
As such, I applaud the decision of the Commission to respond decisively following the compulsory grounding of the European air transport sector.
The Commission has recognised the need not only to consider financial compensation, but also the necessity to speed up the implementation of SESAR measures.
As a general rule I believe that the state should not artificially support business.
Risk, as we all know and accept, is part of running a business.
However, these are exceptional circumstances.
We have not seen such sustained disruption to the industry with such enormous financial losses since 9 / 11 and, notwithstanding the financial difficulties currently facing all Member States, I would urge them to back plans to support an industry which simply cannot sustain further losses.
The question now is, what can and should be done in future to deal with such crises?
Firstly, airlines must be involved in discussions about possible airspace closures from the outset.
Secondly, the SESAR package must be brought forward in a sensible fashion.
I still have some reservations about the creation of a network manager.
I am not fundamentally opposed to the idea, but I strongly believe some questions remain to be answered. For example, what would be the exact role?
To whom would this person be accountable?
How would this improve the current situation?
I look forward to serious debate on the issue, Commissioner, before any legislation is implemented, as a knee-jerk response could prove more damaging than intended.
I also think it would be wise to look at North America and elsewhere to see how they deal with the issue of volcanic ash.
In the UK, we apply the same terms of reference as the ICAO, but the Americans use a different method to calculate the ash drift.
They seem to apply a more measured approach and I believe that we could perhaps learn something there.
In addition, we must remember that when decisions are made in the EU regarding closing EU airspace, the impact of such decisions does not stop at our borders, and discussions with the remainder of the ICAP countries must take place.
Finally, as European policy makers, we have a responsibility to develop a viable long-term strategic vision for aviation in the EU, taking into account the international dimension.
I believe we should support the establishment of measures to improve risk management, settling justified compensation claims without distortion of competition, as well as promoting well balanced, cost effective structural reforms.
Mr President, I hate to have to prolong this further.
What you said in your instructions was that people could either vote in favour or abstain.
The final results show, however, ‘ in favour ’, ‘ abstentions ’ and ‘ against ’.
I understand that there may be many people who would have voted differently if they had known they had the choice of the three.
What I would like to ask is, if indeed this is the correct way to do it, to do it one last time.
Mr President, I thank my colleague, Manfred Weber, for accepting this question.
You said that freedom of movement is not limitless in Europe – and you are juridically right – but that it can be restricted on an individual basis.
What evidence do you have that this kind of deportation is being performed on an individual basis and how can you contradict the information that we have, both
from the press and from the NGOs that have been following this, that the main criterion for deportation, indeed the sole criterion, is an ethnic criterion?
Madam President, it is absolutely vital that our voters are well informed on current affairs.
Information encourages citizens ’ interest in public matters and their participation.
We, as politicians, need a level playing field if our various messages are to get a fair public hearing.
Unfortunately today, the commercial media are increasingly choosing only to entertain our voters.
As a result, they have limited their coverage of current affairs.
Thus, it falls to our public media to do more and more in the field of information and education.
Dangerously, there are some parties and politicians who continue to try to gain control over the public media.
This is happening in many Member States – Italy, Hungary, Romania and France, to name just a few.
We must resist this trend.
Since 1989, the Council of Europe, which has already been mentioned in our debate, has played a magnificent role in setting standards for free and unbiased public media in Europe.
These Council of Europe standards must be enforced in all Member States, both in the former Communist East and in Western Europe.
We as a parliament should work more closely with our neighbours here in Strasbourg on this issue.
Our Member State governments are responsible for ensuring that public media retain their independence and their ability to
provide unbiased information, and we, the European Parliament, should continue to monitor how well they fulfil this public duty.
Madam President, I want to thank and support the Commission and the Council for their work on ensuring adequate financing from the financial sector.
There are, however, a couple of issues.
We support introducing a form of coordinated stability level and a fund, but when it comes to the financial transaction tax, we are talking about an entirely different and much more complex issue.
That tax, as a minimum, would have to be global to avoid tax evasion.
Furthermore, a tax on all transactions might not only be technically infeasible, but would also risk making the markets more volatile and less liquid.
I have some questions on taxes.
If the purpose is to generate money for global causes, which money pots does the revenue go into, and who has the responsibility for distributing the money?
For a tax for a specific purpose, when do we ever know when enough is enough?
Finally, the key question is who will collect the tax – the Member States or the EU?
If it is the EU, far away from its citizens, how do we prevent constant rising taxes?
In the real world, enough never seems to be enough when it comes to politicians ’ need for additional money.
What I would like to say is that the Danish Liberals are very pleased with today ’ s vote on the readmission agreement between the EU and Pakistan.
Finally, after several years of negotiations between the Commission and Pakistan, an agreement has been reached which will allow the readmission of migrants who no longer fulfil the conditions for entry to, or residence in, any of the EU Member States.
This agreement is an important instrument in the struggle against illegal migration into the European Union, especially because Pakistan is an important country of origin and transit of migrants.
With this agreement, Pakistan agrees to take back its own nationals and, under certain conditions, third country nationals too.
This agreement will enhance security on European territory.
Madam President, I am glad to see that the new framework agreement represents a significant improvement in, and deepening of, relations with the Commission, and the special partnership reflects the new power of the European Parliament under the Lisbon Treaty.
As a result of excellent work within the Commission and the working party, the practical solutions included in the proposed revised agreement bring major improvements in legislative procedure and planning, parliamentary scrutiny, obligations to provide information, and the Commission's presence in Parliament.
Welcome Commissioner Šefčovič! Let me draw your attention to two points in particular. I consider the involvement of Parliament in international negotiations a major step forward, facilitating Parliament ’ s consent and giving more predictability to the procedure.
In my view, one of the most important elements is the follow-up of legislative initiative requests from Parliament.
I welcome the development that the Commission undertakes to report on the concrete follow-up given to any legislative initiative requests within three months of its adoption; the Commission shall come forward with a legislative proposal after one year at the latest or include the proposal in the next year ’ s work programme.
If the Commission does not submit a proposal, it shall give Parliament a detailed explanation of the reasons.
As the rapporteur on the European citizens ’ initiative, I hope that the follow-up of citizens ’ requests will also be handled with equally proper respect.
I was glad to see the major backing of the report in committee.
I trust the plenary session will follow the line agreed between the Commission and the European Parliament working party.
Well done and thank you very much.
Mr President, we need to push for a maximum of transparency and accountability on the budget as this will contribute highly to the legitimacy of the EU ’ s external policy.
We are talking about significant sums spent on the basis of regulations which leave a considerable margin of manoeuvre for the Commission.
This is all right, but we need to exert our full scrutiny on strategy papers, multiannual indicative programmes and the like, as they are of a general scope and supplement the financial instruments by defining priority areas and objectives.
The Commission should show its result in an annual report to Parliament with particular attention to the ODA eligibility of all projects.
Programming and planning should be carried out by the same expert people who are doing this now, but the External Action Service itself needs more development and human rights experts to understand and work with these instruments in Brussels and in EU delegations in third countries.
Mr President, the current financial crisis offers the opportunity to make clear headway in the process of European integration.
I want to focus my intervention on the creation of a European common treasury for the eurozone countries.
This would be a clear improvement of the institutional framework for European economic governance.
I know that this is a very delicate issue for some countries, but we will have to deal with it in the coming years.
The European treasury would improve the coordination of the stimulus policies implemented by Member States.
The European treasury would also be able to issue eurobonds to finance the construction of European infrastructures.
The EU needs its own resources in the context of future diminishing budgets in the EU Member States.
A European common treasury collecting some taxes at European level would allow the reduction of national transfers to the EU.
Without real autonomy in income, there will not be real autonomy in expenditure.
The creation of a European common treasury is a political decision.
The sticking point in this discussion is the lack of political will or, to be more precise, the lack of political will on the part of Germany.
In the 1990s, Germany had the political vision to push for the launching of the euro, despite the difficulties faced with its reunification process.
In my opinion, Germany should lead now and move towards a common European treasury.
Madam President, I ask my colleagues to vote against the postponement.
We must speak out before the elections, so it must be now.
It is an issue about fair elections in a European country and that cannot be a partisan issue.
Last time in 2004 we could only speak out after the falsified elections and we were united.
This time there is ample evidence beforehand of security service interference and a massive practice of non-admittance or of fake local party lists to confuse voters.
So let us be united again for the sake of democracy.
I think the massive lobbying of the Ukrainian Embassies throughout Europe towards us to prevent this resolution is proof of how right we are to speak out now.
Mr President, first, let me say thanks to the Belgian Presidency because it is really trying, but they need to do a little bit more.
The European Parliament has shown a lot of goodwill in accepting the figures for 2011 because we understand the economic situation in the Member States.
Regarding commitments, it is even, in real terms, a reduction of the budget.
We have also offered solutions to a number of practical things like ITER institutions, like the financial supervisory authorities and the External Action Service; we have been constructive.
But we do not accept that the economic crisis will be here for ever and that the crisis should set the limits for the future of Europe.
We do not accept that single-minded austerity is the way out.
We do not accept that the crisis requires less Europe or an anti-European agenda.
More concretely, we have criticised the lack of flexibility in the European Union budget for years, and the Commission agrees with us.
So how can the solution to the budget problems suddenly be to restrict flexibility?
How can the future of Europe be to cut funding of mutually agreed priority programmes and not fund new ones – ITER is not the only priority – or even the most important ones.
Without reasonable flexibility, we risk building up a mountain of problems for 2012 and 2013.
Let us try to avoid that.
How can it be a problem to involve the European Parliament in a constructive dialogue on the future financial framework and the next long-term budget?
I do not understand.
Let us try again to find an agreement, but we must find a solution to flexibility that is not less ambitious than what we already have in the interinstitutional agreement.
We must find an open and constructive procedure on the next financial framework.
That is our red line.
Please, Council, try again.
Mr President, first of all, let me thank and congratulate Ms Kolarska-Bobinska for an excellent report and then let me start with a little story from the real world.
Ten years ago, China did not produce one single windmill; today, China houses one of the world ’ s top ten wind-energy companies.
In two years, they expect to have two companies in the top five.
Ten years ago, there was nothing.
Today, China represents 50% of global windmill production.
China is moving and they move fast.
In this light, I am sorry to say, the Commission ’ s new energy strategy is discouraging in its lack of ambition for a greener future.
We need an ambitious energy strategy for Europe, not only in a COP-16 resolution that nobody reads anyway.
We need to implement ambitious, concrete policy targets in Europe.
‘ When the time is right we can get ambitious ’ seems to be the strategy of the Council and Commission.
Well, the time is right and we cannot sit back and relax and wait for some grand international binding agreement before we act.
For an energy strategy to deliver on climate, on growth, on jobs, we need a much more ambitious and market-based approach so that we can use the market mechanism to our advantage.
It is up to ourselves to create a drive in the market, to show the pioneers where we want to go so that they can take us there.
That is why ALDE is calling for the EU to move to a 30% CO reduction target.
The carbon market, the main mechanism for our CO reductions and green investments, does not work.
It is flooded with quotas and the price is too low, so there are no incentives to invest in green technologies.
We believe that the EU needs to make this move for the sake of our economic growth, climate and energy security.
Come on Europe, come on Commission; let ’ s walk the talk.
Mr President, I just want to say that my voting machine did not work for the vote on the European Protection Order, but I would have voted in favour because this is a very important issue and it was important for Parliament to adopt the European Protection Order today.
This legislation is essential for Europe.
The mutual recognition of judgment and judicial decisions is fundamental in an area of freedom, security and justice.
In order to prevent a crime, or a new crime, being committed against a protected person, the executing state is now given a legal base for recognising a decision previously adopted in another Member State.
This legislation is needed for the prevention of violence against women and the other victims of violence.
It is an essential and important step in enabling victims to reside or stay wherever they want in the EU and thereby be included in the freedom of movement.
I hope that you appreciate the fact that I allowed you to speak, although what you raised was not really a point of order.
My job is not to monitor what Members decide to say.
My job is to ensure that they say it when they have the time to say it, as opposed to interrupting each other and doing so, I might add, in a rather rude and loud way.
So thank you for your comment.
I will insist, when I chair at least, that Members conduct themselves in a civil way with each other, and I will try to keep the time as best I can.
What Members say in the room, in a democratic room such as this, is their business, not mine.
Madam President, first I want to congratulate Zita Gurmai and Alain Lamassoure for this report.
I strongly welcome the citizens ’ initiative mechanism.
It is a very positive grassroots initiative.
It will serve to greatly reduce the democratic deficit between the people and the European Union institutions.
Notably, it gives citizens a platform to express and propose ideas for European legislation.
The need for a minimum of one fourth of all Member States to collect signatures for the initiative ensures that the initiative will represent the need for a legislative proposal by a cross-section of society.
Finally, I would like to stress that it is important to have full transparency regarding the founding of the initiative and sources of financial support for the organisers.
Mr President, Parliament ’ s resolution is timely and important.
Thousands of people are subject to caning in Malaysia every year.
Caning is an inhuman and degrading form of punishment which should be abolished everywhere in the world.
Caning is a form of torture.
According to Amnesty International, a Muslim woman was caned last year in Malaysia where Sharia law is applied.
The reason for the punishment was drinking beer.
Amnesty International has also reported on the caning of refugees and immigrant workers in Malaysia.
We urge the government of Malaysia to abolish caning as a form of punishment.
We also call on the Malaysian Government to ratify the Protocol to the United Nations Convention on Torture, as well as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Madam President, I am glad to see that Serbia has shown strong determination and made substantial progress in the integration process.
Concluding the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) and implementing it are the next important steps on this road.
The Serbian Government should be commended for the actions which have been taken to get to this stage.
I am sure that the SAA will bring concrete economic and trade benefits for the country in areas such as environment, energy, transport and many others.
Thirteen countries have so far ratified this agreement.
I hope that its ratification by the European Parliament will encourage the rest to conclude the process soon.
However, there are still challenges ahead for both Serbia and the EU.
Serbia needs to commit to full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in bringing the remaining war criminals to justice.
There is also an urgent need for progress in the fight against corruption and organised crime, and for further reforms in the sectors of justice and public administration.
Equally, the Serbian Parliament needs to abandon the practices of blank mandates and the arbitrary allocation of parliamentary seats.
Finally, the dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo will, I hope, be put on the right track and will guarantee ordinary people better prospects for the future.
The European Parliament has always been a strong supporter of the integration of the Western Balkans.
Serbia is a crucial part of that with this commitment...
Mr President, may I ask the Prime Minister for his attention, please.
I am here, on your left, Mr Prime Minister.
I need to have a frank conversation with you.
I have a text in Portuguese but I am going to improvise in English because that was the language you used in what, for me, was the most important part of your speech, when you said: ‘ look at refugees.
Look at the refugees if you think that war and peace is not important for Europe ’.
You were addressing the new generations.
I have to admit that my heart jumped when you said that, because I am the European Parliament rapporteur for refugees.
During your Presidency, you could have done more than look at refugees.
You could have done something to help; it was not difficult.
The Council could have finished the codecision procedure which Parliament started on resettlement of refugees.
In our part of the codecision, we increased the money that we give to Member States to resettle refugees; we established categories of priorities for people who have been raped, who have been tortured and who have diseases, and who are waiting in camps to be resettled.
The Council has not completed the codecision.
It seems that it was because of Article 290 and delegated acts – something which is in the Treaty of Lisbon.
You say: ‘ look at refugees ’.
But I challenge you to do what we did, go to the al-Hol camp in Syria.
Then tell refugees to look at Article 290, look at delegated acts.
They will say: ‘ what are you talking about?
My kids are not going to school; I do not have a passport; we are stuck in a refugee camp; why are you talking about a minor institutional problem when you could have done something to help our problem?
’ This will tarnish the Belgian Presidency.
I am sorry to say this; I say it in sadness.
Mr President, we witnessed in Tunisia the rising of the people against an oppressive and abusive regime which has denied them basic human rights for years.
It is a big source of shame for the EU that for many years, we have been supportive of this dictatorship.
To make things even worse, the EU risks committing the same mistakes in Tunisia ’ s neighbouring country, Libya.
If the Commission and the Council do not change course, it will continue to prop up yet another dictator in the region in the name of stability and border control and migration.
For years, the Gaddafi regime, one of Ben Ali ’ s best friends as we have seen recently again, has been systematically violating the human rights of its citizens and especially of migrant workers.
Nevertheless, the EU and several of its Member States have increasingly close relations with Libya, and the EU is now even negotiating this framework agreement.
I therefore urge the Council and Commission to notice the writing on the wall and ensure the following conditions are fully satisfied before we can conclude any agreement with Libya: First of all, Libya needs to ratify and implement the UN refugee convention and grant the UNCHR full access to the country; secondly,
it needs to guarantee adequate protection and rights for migrants and adopt asylum legislation including the principle of non-refoulement; thirdly, no readmission agreement with Libya can be concluded until the high risk of inhuman and degrading treatment faced by migrants in Libya has ceased to exist.
And, on that matter, because I do not think this will come too soon, I really wish the Commission to fail in the negotiations on the readmission agreement.
Furthermore, Parliament needs to be fully informed at all stages of the negotiation process.
The Greens strongly object to any dirty deal with a dictator like Gaddafi on the back of migrants and Libyan citizens.
Continued EU support for this oppressive regime is neither in line with the EU ’ s values and legal commitments, nor does it serve its long-term interests in the region.
As we have so vividly seen now in Tunisia, only a democratic and free country will be truly stable and prosperous.
Let us make sure the EU does not commit the same mistake twice.
Mr President, for all too long, our seas have not been truly managed but torn between conflicting economic interests.
Sometimes it is fisheries, sometimes farming, sometimes maritime transport, energy or tourism that sets the agenda.
Regional sea strategies such as the Atlantic or Baltic strategies should be a tool to coordinate and to help identify priority objectives.
We must remember that some policies such as fisheries and agriculture are mostly decided at EU level, but with environmental policies, it is Member States that are mostly responsible.
I therefore believe that the EU integrated maritime policy has an important role to play.
An efficient system of so-called marine spatial planning will be key to prioritising objectives and will guide managers, policy makers and stakeholders.
Cooperation with other States in the Atlantic region is also absolutely essential; in order, for instance, to decrease the amount of microscopic plastic debris, to fight illegal fishing or to ensure that fisheries and environmental regulations are effectively controlled and enforced.
We all depend on healthy seas and good environmental status.
That will benefit all sectoral interests, not least fisheries and tourism.
Therefore, environmental objectives are not only about the environment, but also about a prosperous Atlantic region.
Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr Lange on an excellent report, and a substantive one, to make us think about the trends for industrial policy.
As we come out of the biggest recession for the last 60 years, we really have to galvanise our industries to be competitive in global markets – backing small firms, boosting enterprise, and supporting all those who want to create jobs.
So the linkage between innovation skills and sustainability is evident.
Not necessarily by using funds – we can do this by strengthening the internal market, trade promotion and providing a supportive framework for innovation.
Lastly, one element missing for me is the digital agenda.
Everyone in Europe, every business, should have the right to have access to the best IT, mobile and broadband at super speeds.
Were you aware, Commissioner, that South Korea fixed the aim last week to have, by the end of next year, Internet speeds plugged into every home that will be 200 times faster than those in the average household in the US?
As was said by one senior IT executive, for Europe ’ s competitiveness, one has to realise that it is much better enhanced by investing in IT compared to physical infrastructure.
Mr President, I also want to join my colleagues in the call to support the Iranian opposition and provide for better protection of refugees in Camp Ashraf.
These poor people and their families are constant targets of a brutal and vicious Iranian regime.
Adding to their plight is the daily harassment and hostile attitude of Iraqi forces who are supposed to protect them.
Madam High Representative, let us not forget these sorely tried people.
Together, we need to ensure that the EU plays a key role in their transition from persecuted opposition to a democratic government.
After all, it is in everybody ’ s interest to see – and hopefully soon – a stable and democratic Iran whose citizens enjoy the same freedom and rights as we do here in the EU.
Mr McMillan-Scott, I have an answer to what you have just said and it is that on Monday, this Parliament voted the agenda.
You will see in the agenda that Parliament voted that the calendar votes would take place from 12: 30 to 13: 30.
This is a decision that Parliament took on Monday.
Mr President, I would like to remind the House of the double standards which we are applying.
In the case of the Hungarian media law, an event which took place on Monday was not reflected in our resolution.
Now we are trying to include something which happened only yesterday.
This is a clear double standard which this House is applying, which is deplorable and unacceptable.
Mr President, it has been said in the debate but I will reiterate that we are all aware of the huge extent of the disruption caused by the volcanic ash cloud.
As has been mentioned, over 100 000 flights were cancelled, tens of millions of business and holiday passengers were not able to travel as planned, goods
and cargo were delayed or not transported at all, businesses were affected and our European carriers and airports suffered catastrophic financial losses.
All in all, it cost the European airlines more than EUR 2 billion.
Institutions across Europe and in Member States who were responsible for dealing with such issues were absolutely paralysed and, quite frankly, if it had not been so serious, it would have been practically laughable.
In all this chaos, one thing was clear.
Air transport is enormously important for the European economy and as individuals, we depend on a thriving and efficient air transport industry where safety for crew and passengers is the first prerogative.
As such, I am delighted to support this oral question, not least because during our previous plenary debate on this issue, I called for the European Union to look at international best practice on dealing with volcanic ash and, more particularly, highlighted America, which has always applied a more measured approach in this regard.
I certainly welcomed the fact that the Commission, in its assessment of the crisis, accepted that Europe needed to revise procedures through the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
International best practice tells us that responsibility for dealing with potential hazards related to volcanic ash must be transferred to the airline operators as part of their safety management systems.
The role of the authorities is to audit the airline safety management system to ensure that it meets the required safety standards.
This is the procedure applied by the US and other countries which have managed to deal with volcanic eruptions without major disruptions to air traffic.
Clear and decisive joined-up leadership is essential and we need the European Aviation Safety Agency to ensure that EU Member States adapt their current procedures to guarantee that airline operators will take responsibility and be supported in making such decisions in future.
Lastly, the crisis in April and May last year made it absolutely clear that as a priority, we need to push for the full implementation of the Single European Sky and SESAR.
Both European industry and the taxpayer have already invested huge sums of money in these projects and, as European lawmakers, we must continue to push forward well balanced, cost-effective and structural reforms.
I welcome the comments by the Commissioner today.
Let us hope that we move forward now in a positive way.
Madam President, I regret to say that it seems that this European Council could bring on some dangerous changes, and we should be concerned about this.
Under the banner of so-called economic coordination, economic governance, stability for the euro area, we see a favouring of EU-wide tax harmonisation and EU-wide fiscal unification.
Parliament, unfortunately, has been playing a very active role in that.
Let me speak clearly. The Commission ’ s proposal of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base is a risky step that will undermine healthy tax competition amongst Member States, prove harmful to the economy and drive business away from those who impose the policy.
This has all gone too far and must be stopped.
What we have also seen in the last few days is an attempt by some Member States to interfere in the fiscal and tax sovereignty of others.
You know what I am referring to: the very disgraceful bullying of Ireland.
We must not let this happen again.
Turning to Libya, developments in Libya have reminded us once again that we should not expect too much from the so-called EU Common Foreign and Security Policy.
National leaders, not EU leaders, have shown international leadership.
Prime Minister Cameron and President Sarkozy have made and pushed through decisions – not the EU representatives.
I think that it shows clearly that there are limits to integration in this field – but not only in this field.
No Member State should feel obliged to do more than it feels is right.
This is as valid for foreign policy as it is for economic policy.
Europe must stay flexible wherever possible and not be driven by rigid integrationist dogma any more, and it is time for a change in the EU integration paradigm.
That is clear.
That is understandable, and I hope that the European Council will deal with that.
Madam President, we also welcome the successful conclusion of the second phase of the EU open skies agreement.
Indeed, after several years it was rather overdue.
Obviously this agreement is a significant breakthrough and it is to be welcomed.
I acknowledge that negotiators have made huge progress in the areas of security, competition, market access and environmental cooperation.
But, like the Commissioner, I am disappointed that this agreement did not achieve its ultimate objective of a complete opening of the market without restrictions on either side.
The failure to resolve fully issues of foreign ownership and control (cabotage) must be addressed in future discussions if European carriers are to truly benefit.
Of course agreements mean compromise, but that does not mean getting a deal at any price.
The aviation industry is massively important to Europe.
It facilitates economic growth, trade, investment and tourism.
Air agreements with third countries offer our airlines great opportunities in foreign markets, and I therefore urge the Commission to continue to strive to conclude air agreements which are fair, robust and lead to full liberalisation, which will benefit both European carriers and consumers.
Finally, can we just add our support to the EU-Vietnam agreement.
Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report.
I think that, unlike the other guidelines which we have discussed over many others years in this House, it is focused and it does not get into a whole lot of different details, which are obviously to come later in the budget procedure.
Firstly I would like to say that we in my group would like to take very much into account what is happening elsewhere in the European Union and not just keep it within the Brussels ‘ Beltway ’.
Therefore the paragraph you have put in paragraph 21 – where you are saying that we should be looking for negative priorities and savings by the institutions, asking our specialised committees to be able to look for priorities – is very important, but very little work has been done on this so far.
Tied in to the desire, which I can fully understand, to have more monies available for the Europe 2020 Strategy and the flagships, we should be looking not just for actions which involve money, but strengthening of the single market.
It is not just about monies.
Where we are looking for monies we should be thinking about where we can be generating savings from elsewhere in the budget, as we are looking to do in Parliament and in the other institutions.
We take the line that if you want more money then you can take it from savings elsewhere.
This should also be an important part of our approach to the 2012 budget.
Lastly, therefore, in looking at the kind of responsibility we should take in an era of austerity, if we are going to be able to cope with the savings of financing where we need new expenditure my group believes we should be heading for a freeze in our expenditure for 2012.
Mr President, the March European Council confirmed the EU ’ s role as a promoter of the highest nuclear safety standards worldwide and in the EU neighbourhood.
At least two new nuclear projects at the EU ’ s external border raise serious concern, owing to a lack of transparency and of consultation with the countries affected.
New NPPs containing experimental reactors will be located in the Kaliningrad enclave in between two Member States and only 23 kilometres away from the eastern EU border in Belarus.
The EU, in cooperation with the relevant international bodies, should ensure that the developers comply with the highest nuclear safety and environmental standards right from the beginning of the development stage and should allow international nuclear experts to assess both projects, especially the site selection criteria.
The EU could effectively prevent unsafe nuclear development by refusing to contract energy that will be produced in unclean nuclear power plant stations.
What role does the Commission see in preventing unsafe nuclear development at the EU ’ s external borders?
What measures could it take?
Mr President, I would like to say to the Commissioner that while we were working on the report on your rich document, we were, just like yourself, constantly conscious that the Single Market is there to serve Europeans.
Maybe this is exactly the reason why the negotiations between different political groups on the final form of the text were so difficult.
I do agree with them that even if we do not fall in love with the Single Market, we can be very emotional about it.
It is really good that the European Parliament sends a clear signal today to the Commission and to the Council in the form of 15 priority proposals, and I am personally satisfied that we underlined the importance of the mobility of our citizens.
Better access to banking services; easier recognition of professional qualifications; full portability of pensions: these are the fields in which citizens need solutions in order to study, work and invest in different Member States throughout their lives.
Europeans expect concrete actions from us for concrete needs, and we must deliver.
Take, for example, voice and data roaming charges.
It is high time these stop hindering the mobility of Europeans on this continent – our continent without internal borders.
This issue is also addressed in the document we are going to vote on today.
Finally, the European Parliament is proposing an idea to organise an annual Single Market forum, and this platform should enable a genuine discussion with citizens.
To me, this is a crucial way of involving European citizens in the reform of the Single Market for its 20th anniversary, and for that event I wish all of us much success.
Madam President, I want to propose that the final vote on this resolution be a roll-call vote.
Madam President, better and less expensive data transmission through high-speed broadband for all in 2020: that is an ambitious policy target, I must say, and I fully support it.
But let us face it: it will not come easily.
Nevertheless, I believe that with the Parliament ’ s first-reading position, we will be able to take a big first step towards this goal.
And let us be clear: broadband for all is not only about making sure that everyone has a Facebook profile.
It is about ensuring Europe ’ s place in the world as a leading knowledge-based economy.
If we manage to connect 500 million people, our citizens and businesses will be able to reap all of the benefits and opportunities of the digital economy.
Two things, especially, need to change if Europe is to get there.
Firstly, we need a well-functioning pro-competition telecommunications market at European level.
That is why we have introduced rules on competition-proofing.
Member States should not be allowed to allocate newly freed-up spectrum to a specific market player if that would diminish or distort competition in the market.
Secondly, we need a more efficient allocation of spectrum: an allocation that also more actively reflects today ’ s diverse demands and needs for spectrum.
That is why we are gearing this policy programme not only to free up the 800 MHz band, but also to free up additional bands amounting to at least 1 200 MHz by 2015.
Let me finish by thanking the Commission, the Commissioner, the rapporteur and my fellow shadows for their extraordinarily good cooperation; without it, this level of ambition would not have been possible.
Mr President, it has often been said that our citizens are unaware of the greater powers that this Parliament has had since Lisbon.
This may be true, and it is very unfortunate, because, rest assured, lobbyists – or those pretending to be lobbyists, as proven recently – are very much aware of the powers of this Parliament.
We co-decide on almost all major legislation in the EU, and that is a good thing, because we represent the people of the EU.
We are the only body directly elected by them.
Now, although this is, and will remain, one of the most transparent institutions in the Union, I still believe that with greater power comes greater responsibility, and this is precisely what we must strive to achieve in the months to come.
The agreement today with the Commission is not bad, but lobbyists must be obliged to put their names and their real interests in a register.
And this is what this Parliament is already demanding of lobbyists coming here to us.
I hope that the other institutions will follow suit.
I close by saying the following. As you mentioned, I am a co-chair of this working group that we have in place.
I cannot say much about what we are discussing in detail.
I can assure you, however, that we will ensure that the rules of conduct for this Parliament will be some of the most transparent and will be rules which can make our citizens and ourselves proud of being members of this extraordinary institution.
Dear colleagues, I have a statement to read.
The Casini report on the interinstitutional agreement on a common transparency register between the European Parliament and the Commission represents an important step forward in regulating relations of MEPs with outside interests.
Before we proceed to the vote on the report, I would like to underline that the ongoing activities of the working group on the code of conduct for MEPs and outside interests do not intend to put into question the substance of the agreement reached with the Commission and the content of the Casini report.
They rather aim at complementing the framework by adding new aspects and, in particular, at strengthening the applicable rules as regards access of interest groups to the European Parliament premises.
Madam President, I should like to make this point to the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative: Europe ’ s foreign policy currently lacks leadership, boldness and Community method, and this at a time when the Union has more foreign policy instruments at its disposal than ever.
You, as you often say yourself, are in listening mode: listening to national governments and waiting until they have pronounced themselves.
Then you present the lowest common denominator, and often at times when events have already moved on On Syria, for example, what are you convinced of?
Should Assad be included or not?
What is your opinion?
We would like to hear that.
Do you want to threaten sanctions or not?
You ask us, you did that in your reply, to put pressure on governments, so tell us which ones.
Open the debate.
Sure, Member States often lack the political will to act in a unified and decisive way, and they do not want to see you strong, but believe me, Baroness Ashton, they will not support you and will not save your life as High Representative.
They are not a guarantee for you to stay in your job, I promise you.
And also this does not change the fact that the Lisbon Treaty envisaged a stronger role for you.
You are the rotating Presidency.
You are Vice-President of the Commission.
You can take initiatives.
You should set the agenda.
You should set out in front your opinions, your decisions, and then let Member States react.
If you do not take initiatives, at least do not kill those of others.
For example, the review of the Göteborg Programme on Conflict Prevention: ten years ago, it was initiated by Anna Lindh.
The Hungarian Presidency started a review and wanted you to take it over, but you stopped it.
I do not understand why.
I can only recommend you dare more, delegate more.
Follow Margaret Mead, whom you cited.
Be the agent of change that we need.
I promise you: only this will save your position, and nothing else.
Madam President, I should like to say this to the Vice-President / High Representative: I appreciate very much what you said in your first speech on your policy and what
you have been doing with North Africa – Egypt, Tunisia, Libya – and especially the focus you put on the young people and women there, and your approach to deep democracy that has to be rooted.
I think that is essential, and all of us here in this House share that view with you, so I hope this will be successful.
On the other hand, I agree with many of my colleagues that Assad should have been included in the sanctions.
As my colleague, Danny Cohn-Bendit, asked you, who is the one – or who are the ones – who blocked it in the Council?
Is it Mr Westerwelle or who?
Tell us, and you will find support from us if you are transparent and open with us.
I think that will get support for you.
Explore your mandate.
You will have more support here from us if you tell us more about what is going on in the Council.
Go ahead and tell us.
I think that is true for coherence as well, as you and so many others here have said.
In the Albertini report that we will be voting on this week, we also call for the national policies to be supportive of the EU positions and of you, and I call on my colleagues here in the European Parliament, those of you who are from government parties in your own countries: tell your foreign ministers and your prime
ministers to support the common European policy and not just look into your own domestic interests, including in foreign policy, otherwise we will never get a common European foreign policy for which we need you, Baroness Ashton, to lead, to be ambitious and to be bold in your commitments.
61 years after the Schuman Declaration, which we celebrated two days ago, we need more Europe than ever.
What we want is very concrete: conflict prevention and civilian crisis management, Lady Ashton.
We demand that in the External Action Service, we have independent impact assessments as a standard procedure for the qualitative evaluation of the security, human rights, gender, social and economic effects of each CSDP mission and we need more civilian personnel in these missions as well.
Madam President, words are tools, words are instruments and words can be weapons in foreign policy.
Therefore, they should be used sparingly and prudently, but there are occasions when they must be used decisively.
I would like to say to the High Representative that I sorely missed her voice during the very first few days of the horrors perpetrated by the Syrian authorities.
I believe that the courageous citizens who were – and still are – demonstrating in Syria at great personal risk have missed your voice even more.
There are rare occasions when one needs to speak up immediately.
This was one of them.
Let me now turn to the Middle East.
I believe that withholding of taxes collected in Palestine by the Israeli Government is an ill-inspired action, and what is more, it is
inconsistent first to demand that the authorities of the West Bank and Gaza should find an arrangement – an agreement – and when the agreement comes, to take this decision then.
Moreover, this decision is extremely cynical as it is very likely that the European Union will have to make up for the financial shortfall in any case.
So I support all my colleagues who have called – and I call myself – for a new impetus to a peaceful solution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, which, of course, must be based on the two-state solution.
Madam President, we are not simply discussing domestic problems in the European Parliament.
European values are being questioned in the new Hungarian constitution.
Therefore, we have to discuss it and have to do so now.
There is still time before the adoption of the generic laws.
I hope everyone agrees that the constitution has to be balanced, close to the citizens, based on generally accepted values and principles, and should be party neutral.
Sadly, the Hungarian constitution does not fulfil these criteria.
Even the adoption of the document is questionable.
There was no, or very little, social consultation.
The text is only supported by one political party and it is opposed by major constitutional experts.
The new constitution raises questions on an international level.
For example, there is a lack of reference to EU law in the closing provisions.
We note clear differences, and comparing the text to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the text shows inconsistencies and differences in values and principles.
The principle of good governance does not prevail in the document either.
The constitution fails to provide an EU-conforming, modern, administrative structure.
The aforementioned generic laws are very dangerous.
