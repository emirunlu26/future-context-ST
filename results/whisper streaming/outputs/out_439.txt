6000.0000 0 4960  However, we would point out that because this money is coming from the margin of heading
8000.0000 4960 6940  1A, that will
9000.0000 6940 8100  reduce the margin and
10000.0000 8100 9300  therefore reduce the
11000.0000 9300 9980  availability of
12000.0000 9980 10740  funding for other
13000.0000 10740 12000  projects, which may
13310.0000 12000 13200  be important in the future.
