6000.0000 0 2980  I've been trying to get in touch with this company for several
7000.0000 2980 5820  weeks and only finally this week managed to do
10000.0000 5820 8960  so because miraculously their phone numbers they
11000.0000 8960 10040  give don't have
12000.0000 10040 11140  people at the other end to
14000.0000 11140 12800  answer and they don't seem to
14230.0000 12800 14080  respond to letters either.
