It's only greed, euphoria and cheap money to be blamed for the whole mess
What about the flaws of the region at industry model which has enhanced systemic risk?
Autobots cute pace comes with a lack of ethics which had stimulated reckless restaking
What about investment grade values assigned to trash
What about conflicts of interest?
What about banks engaging in casino type transactions
What about the shadow banking sector with extreme leveraging and speculation
Why haven't policymaker learned from previous crises? Those stern warnings were sent.
just remember what Lampalusi Gramlich focused, Buffett said years ago
The argument that regulation stifle financial innovation I find ludicrous.
Not all financial innovation is sound
is a KOSA International Pants Scheme as it has been developing by toxic products during the past decade to be tolerated
The issue at stake is the lack of proper regulation and supervision. Poor understanding of financial markets, the way they function, and of systemic risk.
Free markets are not synonymous with markets with deregulated markets.
Correction is going to be very painful, especially in the United States, but Europe is not immune to economic downturn.
Solutions should not be patchy and consider that markets are global
International coordination is needed to restore confidence.
The financial crisis rages on and European countries , Eurozone countries are facing recession .
The answer will repeatedly told is that we need more regulation to make the financial sector work better
But we've a problem now And changing the rules after the problem has arisen Is not going to help us with that problem
I urge members to consider a completely different reaction to the current economic difficulties.
They're a signal that we can not continue as we are and that thanks to borrowing that has been too cheap and imports that have been too cheap we've all been living above our means and we cannot go on consuming at the same rate
Adjustment will be painful, but it is necessary. And in these hard times, there is another message that is even more salient, but will not be heard in these institutions.
That is, the EU cannot continue with its massive legislative programs in the name of health and safety, consumer protection, social equality, for instance. For the overriding effects of all these schemes, is to add costs and to crush the productive activity on which our very prosperous prosperity depends.
In these hard times, the one message that should be heard is that European countries can no longer afford the European Union, its institutions and its immense outpourings of legislation. Thank you.
ISIS has demonstrated that the global financial system is seriously flawed
First, the supervisory agencies failed to prevent irresponsible behavior. of investors.
We've seen a development of new financial instruments that are however not transparent enough and they do not allow for proper risk assessment.
Secondly, owners and shareholders of financial institutions fail to supervise property their own managers , who pay themselves exorbitant salaries and bonuses and for what?
for driving their companies to bankruptcies. We need, Mr. President, urgent action at least induced these two areas. Thank you.
We don't want in Europe a repetition of a scenario of American meltdown
We don't want in Europe a situation in which chief executive officers of financial companies go away with tens of millions of dollars while taxpayers are left there to pay their bills.
We expect the Commission to take a serious action on this.
Thank you. There's going to be radical changes in the way the EU produces and consumes its energy.
And this has been based on a three-pronged strategy by the Commission Security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness.
But the Commission left out a fundamental part of this important debate and that is the issue of affordability
Now, since the publication of the Green Paper on Energy, socialists in this parliament have been asking for consumers to be put right back into the driving seat
We want to see energy poverty as a part of this debate
SO FAR IN THE EU THERE ARE NO NATIONAL DEFINITIONS, THERE IS NO DATA COLLECTION, SO WE'VE GOT NO IDEA OF THE SCALE OF THIS PROBLEM.
We know that energy prices have been rising exponentially and they're hitting the most vulnerable in our society the hardest
I'd like to give fair warning to the Council that in the negotiations on the electricity and the gas directives that we're about to start negotiating, the issue of energy poverty will be fundamental to our agreement.
We're not going to step on your toes.
We're asking for domestic action on this, not community action, but we do expect action for the poorest people in the EU on energy poverty.
Sometimes... Questions fly... away... and... This is perhaps a bit obsolete... I must admit... But I feel... the Commission... for giving... such a fair... answer...
My appeal and my worry is that we are overreacting and that I hope the Commission could consider. I
I agree that we should act and react but we should not overdo it because we need a balanced approach
Otherwise, and I think that is something we should consider in the long term, we could harm growth. In Europe. In Europe.
So I think a balanced approach and I rely on the Commission that these measures are in the proper way.
Commissioner, I would like to ask you once more about our famous Signalina atomic plant. I would like to ask you once more about our famous Signalina atomic plant.
Recently, our prime minister met the president of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso. And it was in our paper, there were some interpretations that there is a gap, there is a possibility to prolong this issue. And I think that the
What is your opinion and what would you recommend the Lithuanian government in this situation?
the revolution of the situation in Belarus reveals what Brussels and Minsk could do in order not to lose the momentum for improving the relations.
I support the approach taken by colleague Jan Marinus Viersma, which also mirrors the stance of Belarusian opposition of Alexander Kozulin and Alexander Milinkiewicz.
The policy of the EU to punish Belarus and the Belarusians for the actions of the regime did not achieve the envisage results
It is necessary to open all gates for people to people contacts bring down visa barriers contradictory to the common sense
providing means is really willing to improve cooperation with the EU. This should create more favorable conditions for the kickoff of mutual discussion. Not only externally, but also domestically. .
It can be done by starting talks on the political, economic, social and human rights issues involving all political parties, opposition forces, NGOs, trade unions
We are currently receiving conflicting signals from Minsk and this is already some kind of progress in relation to before but the recent parliamentary election reinforced the popular western image of Belarus as a kind of banana republic
On the other hand, the recent release of political dissidence is a welcome development.
If it is an attempt by Lukashenka to reach out to the West, let's reward his efforts with our cautious support.
But we should be under no illusions about the widespread abuses of human rights and political freedoms in Belarus.
Our focus must be the people and civil society of Belarus , a cause that this house has a noble and vital tradition of supporting even more so after today's speech by Ingrid Betancourt. .
The people of Belarus yearn to take their place in the new Europe.
They need to know that we care and that we will not ignore them.
Like the minister, I've got no wish to make Europe into a fortress and I want sensible security checks and to use new technology
But if I can say I've witnessed the use of these passports and I wonder if he can tell me where I'm going wrong Because what happens minister is a person in possession of electronic passport comes up to a machine Places his or her passport on the reader and then walks through if the passport is in order
And I cannot see how that is doing anything other than checking that that person is in possession of a valid passport .
What it is not doing is checking that the person has got one that's been issued in his or her name
And my understanding, therefore, is that there would be nothing to stop me using, Minister, your passport, providing you were to lend it to me, using your passport to go through a cheque because there's nobody there seeing that the picture or the person is the same or I could be using the passport of a distinguished person like Mr. Macmillan Scott
And I wonder if you can give me an assurance of where the cheque is actually taking place as to the ownership and the actual identity of the person.
Mr. Chairman, I share with my friend and colleague with skill, delight that we are closing loopholes in this directive.
Timeshare is a big industry but it also can be a big scam.
For example, I've been dealing with a company called the European Timeshare Owners Association, which operates in Spain, but conveniently from an address in Gibraltar. And I've had constituents tell me that they were approached by this company, who offered to resell their timeshare.
When they went to Spain at great expense, they found there was nobody to buy their timeshare but this company wanting to sell them other timeshare.
I've been trying to get in touch with this company for several weeks and only finally this week managed to do so because miraculously their phone numbers they give don't have people at the other end to answer and they don't seem to respond to letters either.
And I would hope we would start now to crack down on organisations like the European Timeshare Owners' organisation, because they give Timeshare a bad name and, frankly, they damage the image of the Spanish holiday industry, which I know you care so much about.
Mr. President. The Parliament defends individuals and small organizations , small businesses as opposed to governments who want to sweep away inconvenient things. It is the internal market committee that feels very strongly that the external land border shops should be allowed to remain .
They should be better policed as should all the policing against crime across borders in Europe be much better but it's not a reason to sweep them away
Secondly, on C... and... air travel... the internal market... committee believes strongly... that travel... whose... final destinations... as opposed to... a transit destination... the final destinations... should be allowed... to buy duty free... because that... would help small... regional airports... generate revenue... and...
may be inconvenient to governments but we defend it very strongly
And third and final point that I want to make, very regrettable that the Commission didn't include in its 2006 consultations, on its legislation, a removal of the exemptions, which is now proposing.
Why didn't include it?
Why didn't it carry out an impact assessment on what it would mean before it proposed it?
to President's wealth. It seems as though conservatives and socialists are hands in club with each other on the blue card, leaving my group slowly in amazement, to be very honest.
for a while now the EU is trying to come up with a comprehensive package on migration including measures to tackle illegal migrations as well as measures to push Europe's forward-looking strategy on legal migration
You might remember the very emotional debate on the return directive
At the time, the other group said that the return policy cannot be looked upon in an isolated way, that it should be seen as an integral part, a necessary part of a total package on migration, still now very, very true.
Today, we finally have the chance to give a strong message on the necessity of better possibilities for legal migration. To address the demands of businesses in urgent need of qualified workers.
the fact that we could not expect too much from the PPE on legal migration could unfortunately but could in a way be foreseen
The fact that the PPE is , broadly speaking, happily in line with the PPE on the blue card amendments makes my hair stand on end.
Following the vote in Liebe, the scheme has been watered down significantly.
Far too many restrictions have been introduced. Not in any way of help while trying to make the EU more attractive for highly qualified workers.
It must be clear that the intention of the blue card is to increase the competitiveness of the EU economy
The Blue Car proposal is not an easy attempt to take the best and leave the rest thereby creating a brain drain from development countries
The current trend is that the vast majority of the highly qualified workers emigrates to the US, Canada, Australia instead of the EU.
If we want to reverse these trends, we have to be ambitious.
This house is about to adopt a report that would weaken even further an already very modest commission proposal
To be clear, ODE is a very strong supporter of the blue card.
However, we do feel that the current text does not bring about the much needed change for legal migration, but that it confirms Member States protectionist practices instead
And we all know that council has shown to be excellent in summing up ambitious statements, but we also now know that too often effective decision making is constrained by the inability of the membership
states to really work together in their mutual interest. That effective decision making in this field is being undermined by a very emotional and muddled debate on legal migration due to a very simple lack of focus.
The program of Tampere, the Hague program, the French immigration pact, the Stockholm program coming up. At the end of the day it all comes down on the transposition of these basic commitments into concrete and effective measures.
So if we do indeed want the EU to benefit from the proposed scheme, we have to be ambitious. So please, I do hope that you will vote accordingly tomorrow.
President, ever since I had the honor of drafting the report on combating HIV-AIDS with the EU and neighboring countries, I have been very committed to this issue with all its implications and ramifications for people living with HIV.
One year ago, the framework of the conference HIV in Europe 2006 participated in the participants' comprehensive call to action on measures how to effectively tackle HIV. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS.

Some elements of this call are now also reflected in this joint motion for a resolution
The aim of this resolution is to contribute to the fight against HIV-AIDS on a political level.
Therefore it calls on the Council, on the Commission, to formulate a comprehensive strategy on HIV to promote early diagnosis and ensure early care and communicate the benefits of earlier care to all European citizens. The
It calls on the Commission to commit substantial resources to deliver the above-mentioned strategy as well as asks member states to step up information and educate campaigns on prevention , testing, and treatment.
I am aware that the Commission is planning to bring forward a new communication on combating HIV in the EU and the neighbourhood and also that the Commission of ACIDU confirmed her personal commitment to take further action. In this field.
To conclude, Madam President, this situation needs to be urgently tackled.
and consistent enforcement of environmental legislation is essential for its credibility for a level playing field and for ensuring that the environmental objects will be met.
the issue of environmental inspections is therefore very important for the work of my committee. The committee on environment , public health and food safety.
On 14 November, the Commission published the communication on environmental inspections in the Member States.
This communication requires a recommendation of your European Commission from year 2001. It provides minimum criteria for environmental inspection .
The communication contains some worrying messages
It states that the information submitted by the member states on the implementation of requirements , is incomplete or difficult to compare .
it states that there are still large differences in the way environmental inspections are being carried in the EU
It states that the scope of the recommendation is inadequate and that it does not include many important activities. So, it states that the scope of the recommendation is inadequate and that it does not include many important activities such as Natura 2000 and the control of illegal waste shipping.
It states that inspections plans have not been implemented and where they do exist that they are often not publicly available
By committee noted with concern the conclusions from the Commission stating that the full implementation of the environmental legislation in the community cannot be ensured.
This would not only lead to continuing damage to the environment, but also to distortion of competition within and between the member states. Thank you.
My committee therefore formulated four questions through the Commission which can be summarized as follows
Why thus the Commission only wish to amend the recommendation and why does it not propose a directive on an environmental inspection? Thank you.
The second, why has the commission opted instead for attaching the environment inspections requirements to existing directives individually? The second, why has the commission opted instead for attaching the environment inspections requirements to existing directives individually? A process that will take a lot of time.
The third was the commission not prepared to use a directive to define terms such as inspection, and audit, which are interpreted in different ways by Member States .
Fourth, why is the Commission not prepared to transform IMP? L into an effective EU environmental inspection? Force?
I would like to thank the Commission in advance for the reply and I would like to conclude by emphasizing that my opinion the implementation of
and enforcement of environmental legislation should get the same political attention as the adoption of the legislation in the Commission, in the Council and in Parliament.
global rules for the financial markets becomes much harder
Sensible people would say that a massive failure of both regulation oversight, together with revealed flaws of an overly simplistic economic paradigm, provide an indubitable asset to what to do
but some still argue that self-regulation should be the norm of the new system.
In my view, they are wrong whether they honestly think so or are driven by parochial interest.
One of Cain's intellectual agacies, the highly volatile captive flows or inimical to trade and well-being, has shown its relevance in the current huge mass and other episodes of crisis including in emerging markets.
For the case now a mantra has been heard worldwide that not much can be done in national policy making because global markets would punish a government.
but is the complexion of global financial markets God given?
are not global markets aside from the technological drivers, also the product of human beings' decisions to set rules of finance, trade and investment.
The claim that nothing can be done about finance when it brings about misery is unconvincing
Much can be done in regulating all financial entities including hedge funds and private equity funds, constraining leverage, dealing with pro-cyclicality, accounting, coordinating policies better, dealing with the rating agencies,
the decline of a paradigm which equates market economies with no regulation has to be seen in conjunction with a rising multipolar economic role in the attempt to forge a new international financial system
on the latter hinges the fate of an open world economic system .
unless we do the right things now we run the risk of crippling our liberal democracies
I hope that the new American administration will be forthcoming in this respect.
But we in Europe have to rise to the momentousness of this period
President. The guest. Crisis has. Left. Hundreds of. Thousand. Of. How. Holes. Across. 17. European. Countries. We. Out. Heating. During. Freezing. Temperature.
Eastern and Central Europe has been affected the most by the dispute which has shut down factories and schools.
Even if Kiev and Moscow sign the EU brokered deal after hours of talks with EU official Gazprom says that the deal to restart gas supplies to Europe via Ukraine will be delayed as it has not received a copy of the agreement.
the team of technical experts sent by the European Commission will check flows into Ukraine pipelines from Russia and even if the gas starts to flow in Ukraine it may take about 36 hours for it to reach EU state
As a result, Europe needs a single policy on energy security in order to avoid future conflicts and its need to diversify its energy sources of support .
I welcome the intervention of the Parliament in the dispute and hope that an agreement will be reached as soon as possible in order to avoid a deepening conflict.
Chairman. I would like to also congratulate Mr. Landstuhl for the excellent work he has done and of course his shadows, particularly Mrs. Sedersholt. But let me also underline something that Mr. Tubon said, the fantastic work done by the French Presidency in achieving agreement on this directive.
I hope that when we return to it in a few years we will realize that we should not have been afraid of talking about the European defence equipment market because of a common European market
it is in the common defense interest of Europe and it is in the common interest of Europe to have no competition.
Let me highlight one part of this directive which is highly important for many member states and this is particularly the texts concerning subcontracting
I am very happy that the agreements reached with the Council and the Commission on the text of subcontracting have been reflected to a large extent what Parliament has been pushing for namely that there is more transparency in terms of subcontracting secondly
that there is no discrimination on a national basis , online subcontracts are being drafted, and finally that national authorities have the ability to allow contractors to subcontract more than 30, up to 30 percent of their contracts.
This is in the interest of bringing our industry together across Europe
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
It is with great regret that together with my two Maltese colleagues in the PES we have had to abstain on the report
Although the report refers to numerous issues of fundamental human rights which are laudable, it includes other issues such as abortion, which would never have been included in this report.
As the multi-social representatives in the European Parliament are against abortion, we have had to vote against these particular parts of the report.
Indeed, there are other issues included in this report, such as living wills and the right to dignity at the end of life, which are sensitive issues regarding which we have had to abstain
That is why we abstained at the end of this vote
May I thank you for this opportunity.
Thank you, presidents. For all those who observe the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this might be a time in which we attempted to put our hands in the air and scream in despair.
I don't think we should, however, because I think the greatest test of our humanity today is to really understand the issues at hand.
The first issue is that there can be no lasting solution to this conflict without stopping the bombardment of Israel.
The second issue is that there cannot be a lasting solution to this conflict without opening Gaza to humanitarian aid.
and indeed President Peres has been absolutely right in saying that Gaza should be open for aid and not enclosed for rockets.
I think this is quintessential and everyone agrees to this
there cannot be a return to the status quo ante and I think we could do a number of things here
firstly the Parliament can bring both sides together to talk secondly we should stand behind the Commission and the Council and support their efforts and finally we should firmly support the Egyptian track of negotiations because that is the only track that can lead to a solution and to a ceasefire currently which we all hope for
I didn't expect that. Mr Vondra, I'm glad to see you're back.
So thank you for explaining the gravity of the situation but when is the Council going to learn that until the EU speaks with one voice on energy issues in particular in relation to Russia and Ukraine we are going to be in a weak position
I'm going to give you an example where the Council doesn't do that
we shall shortly be starting negotiations on the second reading of the energy liberalisation package
The Commission came up with a very carefully crafted position on third countries investing in the EU suggesting that the Commission speak on behalf of the EU on these issues
And what have you in the council done?
You've retreated to national positions and said no, we member states, we want the final say, not the commission
It's this divide and rule the oldest trick in the book that you minister and your fellow colleagues have fallen for
Until you understand that pooling your powers to gain more leverage internationally is the way to go, we will always be in a position where we are vulnerable
And you must answer the European citizens as to why they are now sitting in the cold
You have to change your position on this line.
Will you do so, Mr.
We're in turn on regional conflicts continue to undermine peace and security
that creates humanitarian disasters and paralyze the development of this strategically significant region.
Each war, each conflict, accentuates the fragility of the state
At the heart of most of these conflicts is the lack of leadership and democratic governments rightly put forward in the report of the EP delegation.
What this region needs is home chrome democratization Respect for national international rule of law and above all national recovery .
About Somalia I would like to emphasize that the resignation of former President Youssef and the withdrawal of Ethiopian forces create a huge window of opportunity
The time has come to pick up the pieces and bring about intra-Somali peace
The Somali parliament is a crucial factor for confidence building and can make the peace process all inclusive
Furthermore, it is imperative that the EU supports the renewal and the strangling of African Union Peace Force. The EU supports the renewal and the strangling of African Union Peace Force.
This force needs a decent UN mandate
If not Uganda, then Burundi forces will pull away from Mogadishu leaving a security gap behind
I entirely agree with Commissioner Freda Waldner
There is a momentum for change now in Somalia that should be taken advantage of
the power as well as the security vacuum must be filled
if not the stateless chaos from known as Simalia , will remain.
Mr. Evans, for one and a half minutes. I'd like to congratulate Mr. Parrish for bringing this forward.
despite our political differences and not withstanding his well very obvious deficiencies as a human being I think he's actually very sound on this and I support him
we need this regulation to be a success and we need it to be universally enforced but I do have a number of reservations and I have to say I disagree with some colleagues who have spoken this morning
Mr. Stevenson, you say that longer journeys were unavoidable. Well, I say not so too.
Mrs Jensen, you spoke of 24 hours transport Not necessary
On the agricultural industry Mr. Mahalister I think has got to ask questions of itself
We need as a society, a civilized society, to look at the whole question, the whole purpose, the whole idea of transporting animals long distances and then killing them
Now if I were a meat-eater I would be asking how can the suffering en route which we know about, the dehydration, the stress, and to our Irish colleagues North and South, how can sea journeys, the very idea of them, how can this possibly improve the quality of the product at the end
To my mind, it makes no economic sense
It doesn't make humanitarian sense
which is why I favour a complete ban on the transport of animals which I believe would support rural economies
It would encourage local producers, yes, a small and medium enterprises as someone spoke of, and it would enable consumption of food as near the point of production as possible.
In the absence of that, and I know it's not going to happen in the near future, I think we need proper, realistic enforcement of what we've got at the moment, the regulation, and I urge the Commission to use all
agency across Europe , police forces on motorways if necessary to stop and check lorries to see whether they are carrying out the full requirements of this legislation.
Please. Thank you. You could have guessed what these reports would say.
We've got a problem and the European Union has got to give its opinion.
It's good to give the impression that it's in the driving seat to solve the problem
So we have a European Economic Recovery Plan of which the car industry is a part
But in reality, each manufacturer is going to look after itself as best it can, and each country will look after its manufacturers as best it can.
There is, of course, a possible case for some financial support to the car industry and other sectors to keep capital intact and to keep skills intact. There is a possibility for some financial support to the car industry and other sectors to keep capital intact and to keep skills intact.
But this can only be decided to the national level because the support, apart from the European Investment Bank mentioned by Mr Verheugen, that support can only be provided by national taxpayers. Thank you.
But there is one thing that the European Union can constructively do here, at least until the recession is over, and that is give car manufacturers a break from environmental restrictions .
The industry is already in serious trouble
These environmental and other standard restrictions make cars more expensive
You're hoping to kill off an industry which is already in serious bother
Mr. President, regarding the report of patients right in cross-border healthcare, I would like to emphasize the issue of the patients right to be informed about the available medication and treatment options. Thank you.
The European patients should have access to quality health information regarding the latest medication available , the treatment option home and abroad , the legal and the financial implication of being treated abroad , the reimbursement of the treatment cost and many others
For the moment, we don't have this type of quality information.
we may have some national initiatives but nothing that could be effective at the European level
the problem that we face are Europeans.
Therefore, I support the idea of setting up a European health literacy network
Such a network should consist of patient organization from all the member states and should work closely with the health sector and the policy makers
in the hope of challenging the European Commission of the need to better inform the 150 million European patients I initiated a written declaration on health literacy .
We have all been patients at some point and we never know when it will happen again
Thank you, Madam Chair. I'd like to refer this report back to Committee under Rule 165.
both this democratically elected parliament and European Commission see the necessity to cover some modest forms of cooperation between the EU and the developing countries. Actions that are not , strictly speaking, poverty alleviation, such as exchange programs between universities, here and there.
The budget for development is not meant for this kind of cooperation. But some members insist on using a legal base that would lead us to finance these actions with the development budget, while that is precisely what we seek to avoid with this report.
We did not reach an agreement
If Amendment 1 is adopted, this report would become incoherent and contrary to the interests of the world's poorest people.
Therefore, I consider we better refer this report back to the Development Committee in order to agree on a legal base having the support of a clear majority of this House
Mr. Chairman, I welcome this report. We just wanted two small reservations.
We've heard from my colleague Mrs Gill how important small businesses are to the economy and how they're bearing the brunt of the difficulties at the moment
The trouble is the European Union is geared entirely for big businesses, whether it is about legislation or whether it is about access to markets or about funding.
and we often talk about better regulation. What we mean really is proportionality.
We have to ensure that our legislation is proportional to the problems we are dealing with, particularly in the IPPC that we have talked about today.
It's really about big business, not about small businesses and we should reflect that.
I do welcome initiatives like Jasmine which I think are moving in the right direction but we do need to think in terms of funding, in terms of market access, in terms of legislation about the specific needs of small business.
And can I make one particular plea? We've got a single market, but we don't have a single community patent.
We've been at this for years and years and years now and it really is a disgrace that we can't sort out this problem
It could by itself be the biggest helpful businesses in the European Union
Let's have some action.
Commissioner, I welcome the European Commission green paper and its objectives to increase the visibility of the issues around EU health. workforce and to identify challenges and further action that can be taken.
But I wish to take the opportunity to emphasize one aspect of the green paper that is the training of the health workforce.
I initiated a written declaration on this issue number 95 that is ongoing
I strongly support the idea that it is absolutely essential to develop training communication courses for health workforce in order to provide clearer and more complete information to patients. Thank you.
Patient's ability to understand health and medical issues and direction is closely related to the clarity of the communication.
Despite various initiatives to improve the quality and availability of health information , studies in indicate that patients want more information than they currently receive. . And that health professionals tend to overestimate the amount of information that's supplied.
Madam President. As you said on Monday evening the Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted a motion regarding the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka pursuant to rule 91.
The situation in Sri Lanka is clearly very serious but exactly what is happening regarding the humanitarian situation is far from clear
I'm conscious, President, that there are many different views across this house
And so I suggest that the most sensible course of action would be to timetable a proper debate which can't seriously be fitted in this session but could be in our next session which is just 10 days away
I'm grateful to Mr. Dole of the EPP for indicating his group's support for this course of action
And as we're a serious chamber, Madam President, I suggest and ask colleagues to support a debate with resolution and full participation next section, next session, to do justice to the gravity of the situation in Sri Lanka.
Mr. President, I would like to speak about a very important issue related to the European Prize for Literature.
The prize is financed by the cultural program of the European Union , a detail to put to the spotlight on the creativity in the field of contemporary fiction.
I think it is very good initiative but I have my concern about its implementation.
I have been contacted by cultural organizations from my country who are unhappy because Romania is not included this year in the program.
Indeed, out of 34 eligible countries, only 12 are included each year in this program
The legitimate question is how could the remaining countries including Romania take an active part if they are not included at all in the program
so I would like to bring this problem to your attention and I hope we will find together with the European Commission a convenient manner to settle this problem.
Mr. President, what worries me most is the suggestion that the European Investment Bank has a significant role to play in solving the financial crisis, that it can somehow act as the European wide-body to provide stimulus where member states of singularly failed to coordinate their own stimuli.
The danger is that if it expands its activities too far into supporting commercial banks and governments as has been suggested then its enviable high credit rating may be downgraded like some of our governments
The EIB has a leverage of about 35 times and its shareholders are member states governments
It would be a serious issue if it were to go bust like some of our commercial banks
The report, even encourages the EIB and the Commission to increase lending by experimenting with new innovative financial instruments. The
I thought the world had seen enough of clever financial tricks
Mr. President out of this budget review we simply have to ask ourselves one question does the budget reflect the political priorities of the 21st century and
If it doesn't, it needs changing.
Is it flexible enough To reflect changing times
was one of my frustrations at the moment with the budget is how we deal with negative priorities
too much is left in the budget because we cannot change things because of the restrictions of the MFF
If I could turn to activity-based budgeting and management , I and the Commission have made huge progress on this, but I would warn against over-bureaucratising this exercise because what we want to ensure is a qualitative evaluation , not simply ticking boxes.
We don't want people spending all their time evaluating themselves when they should be getting on and doing some work
So we've got to be careful about that.
and I particularly personally think the annual policy statement strategy would be better if it was every two years or every two and a half years to fit in with the parliamentary cycle
This will allow us to get a much clearer idea of our policy perspectives on top of the Commission's annual work programmes.
President Commissioner, I speak to the Van Nisselrooy report. And to emphasise three points. Thank you.
First, a territorial cohesion involves promoting polycentric development across the European Union
This means eliminating disparities within as well as between regions
There is consequently a need for improved spatial analysis and the development of indicators against which policies can be designed and their impact assessed.
Second, there must be an integrated approach with measurement in advance of the effect that sexual policies would have at regional levels and the achievement of greater synergy between them
Certainly such impact assessment could preempt certain problems such as those posed by the electronic identification of sheep and Scotland.
Third, an integrated approach demands proper multi-level governance. Involving all states, stakeholders in the design and implementation of strategies.
What the commissioner has said in these respects has been very welcome and I hope for great support for this excellent report
President of the Commission, Minister, I would like first to thank the Czech Presidency for the successful summit and
I think the summit has come up with a number of important decisions, but at the same time I am of the opinion that we need more and we need to move faster.
When we go to the G20 meeting in London in a week time , I have that impression we are still too integrated. To act alone, and to divide it, to act together.
I see three main priorities which we should focus on.
The first, of course, jobs.
million of people in Europe are afraid of losing jobs and frankly I don't understand the position of the French President which opposes the summit, a full-fledged summit is indeed something we need at this moment.
Second, I'm happy that we managed to eliminate partly at least protection ist tendencies
Nevertheless, they are still alive and I think the solidarity is the key
And the third point, the keys to restore confidence in the markets
I'm not even... of the opinion that there is too little money in the market. I think there is enough money.
The problem is to transform this money into effective demand and for that to happen we need to restore confidence among households and enterprises.
has a turbulent history in regard of totalitarianism and restriction of basic freedoms.
In some parts of Europe of the 20th century was hallmarked by such totalitarian regimes
It is our moral obligation today to make sure that every citizen of the European Union enjoys the same rights.
It is highly important for the EU to support also the right of minorities, especially since many countries all around the world do not respect very basic rights in this sense.
In the same time, I would like to point out that while the EU speaks out against discrimination and violation of human rights in cases like Tibet, it is clear to all of us that even within the European Union there are ethnic and linguistic minorities which very often are targets of cultural and linguistic assimilation.
This practice of some national states in the EU is an aspect that should be taken into serious review and reconsideration.
The Hungarians in Romania, the people I represent,
I am one of those people who would like to ensure the continuity of Internet freedom.
Creators of the internet had great faith in the basic goodness of humankind. I tend to share that faith
Unfortunately, very often the internet just like in any human society we have to face the sad fact that regulations are needed to make sure that those who cannot protect themselves would be protected too
The safety of an individual is a fundamental right just as much as the right to free speech and to self-expression .
Abominations as Child Pornography and Pedophilia just as well as Internet Fraud must be stopped.
We cannot tolerate internet predators of any kind and while we discuss this topic of great interest I would like to bring your attention to a much less discussed fact
The internet is also full of sites that incit to hatred , violence and intolerance towards all kinds of minorities among them ethnic minorities
It is an aspect of the internet that meets our attention
We have to make sure that minorities feel protected
It is unacceptable that many extremist groups use the internet to instigate to hatred and xenophobia.
Thank you, President. This package, the energy package, is a culmination of years of hard work in which the Parliament can be very proud of the changes that will now be put in place.
We should in particular be proud of the fact that the EU energy consumers have now been put right at the centre of the energy debate for the first time and the issue of energy poverty has now been recognised at the European level
The inherent conflicts of interest that arises when a company owns both transmission and generation of electricity has been addressed and the regulatory regime governing the energy markets has been strengthened .
The electricity directive which I was rapporteur is a part of a package of five measures which seeks improvements in the way the electricity and gas markets work across the continent to ensure that the markets are better integrated and operate in a fairer and less discriminatory way
Can I say how grateful I've been for the enormous cooperation from the other rapporteurs on this package, also the shadows, the commission and the Czech presidency for helping us to come to a conclusion on what was sometimes a very challenging debate
The legislation has seen a raft of new consumer protection measures set out including ensuring that customers are able to switch suppliers within three weeks The provision in each member state of an independent and robust complaint system and the right to compensation if service leveraged are not met .
This legislation has also ensured that every household in the EU will be fitted with so-called smart meters by 2020 .
These smart meters will enable customers to better control their energy use and increase energy efficiency . Helping to cut energy costs and reduce carbon emissions. .
On the European Parliament's initiative, the new legislation also includes special protection measures for vulnerable energy consumers . The issue of energy poverty will now have to be taken seriously for the first time.
I'd like to ask the Commissioner, Mr P. Belks, if it will now make a commitment that in future the energy framework of the EU, in addition to addressing
the security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness will also now add a fourth leg that of affordability to all future energy policy proposals.
An EU-backed report has recently concluded that up to 125 million citizens are affected by energy poverty .
Member States now must take appropriate measures which could lead to the prevention of hundreds if not thousands of deaths to the poorest households. Across the country. Continent.
We'll also see the anti-discriminatory pricing on prepayments .
The most controversial part of the package centred on whether there was a need for full ownership and bundling in the energy markets. In other words, a total separation of transmission systems from generation.
The market structure in some Member States means that the monopoly enjoyed by transmission system operators who also own the means of generating electricity offers no incentive to encourage other players on to the market , thereby undermining competition .
The Parliament has now accepted a compromise that will allow ownership for both transmission and generation on conditions that we see increased checks and balances to ensure the removal of the inherent conflicts of interest that arises .
Many of us reluctantly accepted the compromise because we believe that the wind is blowing in the direction of wholesale separations and these integrated companies are likely to separate regardless of this directive .
The Commission's efforts in exposing the abuses of some companies is starting to pay off, with examples of companies like E.ON and RWE agreeing to sell their transmission networks following antitrust investments. The Commission's efforts in exposing the abuses of some companies is starting to pay off, with examples of companies like E.ON and RWE agreeing to sell their transmission networks following antitrust investigations.
We're also going to see a strengthening of national regulatory authority 's
I'd like to thank everybody for their cooperation and I think we should be proud of what we've done for the consumers of the EU.
I'm waiting for the report. I would like to address the content in the wider context of common fisheries policy.
In the last ten years I've heard many criticisms of it, including the lack of a level playing field, insufficient stakeholder involvement, inadequate balancing of economic, social, and environmental issues, and the lack of a level playing field, insufficient stakeholder involvement, inadequate balancing of economic, social, and environmental imperatives, and too much by way of micromanagement from the centre.
Recently though I've been able to assure people that the policy is undergoing significant change.
Of course, there is still a long way to go, eliminating discards for example, and there are times when the Commission still seems to veer towards macro-management.
I mention here article 47 of the control regulation at least in its original version
I have often said though that the common fisheries policy is a bit like an oil tanker. It takes a considerable time to turn round. I do believe that the control regulation will go a long way to achieving the
necessarily playing liberal playing field where enforcement and sanctions are concerned . Just as the development of regional advisory councils shall do so much to bring improvements in other respects
so I would like to finish on a personal note by expressing my appreciation of the valuable work done by members of the Fisheries Committee throughout and by thanking Commissioner Borges and his team for all that has been achieved in their five years at the helm.
Thank you, Chair. The Parliament has moved from its first reading position on the Electricity and Gas Directive
but I'd just like to briefly explain why
The report as it stands is far from perfect but we believe that we have made substantial gains for consumers of energy in the European Union
We've put the issue of energy poverty onto the European agenda for the very first time and we've ensured that the independence and given an increased role for the national regulatory authorities to police the new system
We'd like however to encourage the Commission and in particular the Competition authorities to continue their work in ensuring that companies that own both generations and transmission systems play by the rules and don't abuse their positions
Can I thank colleagues for all their help over the years
Madame le PrÃ©sident, I'm glad in the end, common sense has prevailed in the European Parliament, in the Commission concerning the causes of this financial crisis.
People have realized that this crisis is not of a cyclic in nature, that a thorough overhaul of the regulation and supervision of financial markets is badly needed.
The DeLarongere Group Report and the Turner Report 2 have made it quite clear
These reports are in analytical tune with the Lampolucy follow-up report of the parliament
The documents which are debated today are to be seen in the same logic of action
Unfortunately, our economies will still suffer for quite a while, not least because of the public budgets and probably future inflationary effects of the efforts which are being undertaken to clean up the huge mess.
Let us hope that we'll learn this time more than it was done on previous episodes of Crisis
Thank you very much President, I want to congratulate both our rapporteurs
A couple of years ago I was the rapporteur for access for disabled passengers to aeroplanes
And this legislation is another piece in the jigsaw to make transport as inclusive as possible or as our colleague Mr Albertini put it to consolidate passenger rights
In an age, President, when we're encouraging people to travel by public transport, it's so important that we add coaches and buses, as Mr. Albertini has, to this field.
Some members, not necessarily those here today, have looked for ways to make exemptions to exclude certain sections. But I've always taken as my starting point the desire to include as much as possible in this, so we move towards making Europe more of a common market for people.
And that's why Amendment 81 is so important.
The Commissioner in his remarks said we need the same rights to all passengers with no exceptions and then he spoke about the exceptions for example for regional transport
I don't think we should exempt regional transport and I've done some research
in some of our member states a regional coach journey can take up to six hours which is longer than an international coach journey from say london to brussels or paris
so I think it should be included.
I think it's right that where local transporters, Mr. Yaw Zimboski has referred to, is not included, there are public service contracts which mean that the companies will reach the same sort of standards.
I also think we need to persuade the construction industry to build more modern buses with the needs of disabled people more in mind
just as we have campaigned for airplanes to be more accessible for disabled people so we need perhaps coaches with wider gangways or more accessible toilets and we need the operating companies president to make their coach terminals more accessible accessible and to train their staff in disability and disability awareness issues
But this is a good report
a good collection of reports which takes us several steps forward and I congratulate everyone who's been involved.
Mr. Chair, the International Community has been absolutely appalled at the information that we have all seen about the law that is being drafted in Afghanistan on the status of Shia women.
It is indeed appalling to believe that one can, at the beginning of the 21st century, in a country that wants to be a democracy and wants to abide by its international commitments, to have a law that limits the rights and of women.
However, I believe that in our debate and in everything that we do with Afghanistan we have to be very careful how we approach things because Afghanistan is a country that comes through a violent
Repressive religious dictation. In his endured years and years and decades of civil war . It is a society in which people more than buildings have been hurt and destroyed.
that we have to be very consistent in our messages but we have to be also very careful in how we phrase those messages
We should call on the Afghan authorities to take a look at the law, to revise it and make sure that it is entirely in line with the international commitments of that country as well as its constitution.
We should not use this as an election opportunity here for us in Europe, but we should actually use it as something that we can pass on to our colleagues and friends in Afghanistan to make sure that they can actually fulfill the obligations that they have voluntarily undertaken themselves.
We have to assist in this case President Karzai and the Government of Afghanistan in revisiting this law and making sure that it is indeed in line with the international commitments in the Constitution.
It is part of our dialogue and I think we have to be absolutely firm that there should be no measures adopted that can actually impede the rights of women
I agree entirely with Mrs. Anna Gomes has just said
But let us be very careful that when we deal with a society that has been so traumatized, it is far more important how our messages are heard there than how our messages are understood here
Let us be very consistent in that and let us call on the Commission and the Council to pass this message through all of our assistance programs to the government and the authorities in Afghanistan.
Mr. President, honorable colleagues, this is the situation of canvas rough, home of 3500 members of the main democratic opposition of Iran, the PMOI, has been of great concern for some time and has been the issue of several resolutions in this house in recent years.
TOGETHER WITH A DELEGATION OF FOUR MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE VISITED CAMBAS RATH IN OCTOBER LAST YEAR AND MET WITH AMERICAN , IRAQI AND U.N. OFFICIALS. THERE.
They all reinforce our concern for the legal status of ASRAFs residents because the security was transferred from American troops to Iraqi forces from the beginning of this year
The situation has got much worse since then
The Iranian supreme leader in an official announcement at the end of February asked the visiting Iraqi president to implement the mutual agreement of closing down Kambas Rafah and expel all the residents from Iran .
Since then, a sage and surrounding by Iraqi forces has started around the camp.
Iraqi troops have been preventing entry of families of Afraf residents , parliamentary delegations , human rights organizations , lawyers and journalists and even doctors to the camp and do not allow many logistical materials to give into Afraf.
This parliament found it absolutely necessary to address this as an urgency issue at this stage
We have now worked together with all groups and produced a common text which is well balanced and addresses all our concerns on this matter and calls on international bonds to find a long-term legal system. We have now worked together with all groups and produced a common text which is well balanced and addresses all our concerns on this matter and calls on international bodies to find a long-term legal status for ASRAF residents.
Unfortunately, some amendments tabled by some of the spokesmen for Tehran , those are those who believe in the lies told by Tehran
I think we should clearly understand that this is contrary to this security of the residents of Asra , and we should vote them against them. Thank you.
We urge all colleagues to stick to the joint text and reject any amendments
Mr. President, on behalf of one of my constituents, I want to raise the case of a young man with dual British Greek nationality. His name may be John Zafiropoulos. He is a young man with dual British Greek nationality.
Last year, he was convicted by a first degree Greek court to serve an unconscionably severe sentence in prison in Greece
From the information I've been given, Mr. President, I consider that the crucial rules relating to Greek legislation, as well as the provisions for fair trials, have been violated.
These fair trial provisions are defined by all of Europe and are the rights of every European citizen
At the start of this year I wrote to the Greek minister of justice in Athens to alert him about my concerns
The response which I received three months later was signed by Minor Ministry employees and made no reference to the matter which I had raised with the Minister. In other words, the breaking of the rules about fair trials.
So I'm very concerned about this Mr. President and for this reason I'm raising it in the parliament right now hoping that Athens will both send me a proper reply and will deliver a full and fair review of the case of Mr. Zafiropoulos
Thank you, Madam President. This final proposal on seal hunting is wholly unacceptable. As it grossly interferes with other countries' affairs .
Yet these countries play by the rules and all they're trying to achieve is to manage their natural resources and provide employment to their people.
This proposal destroys people's lives and their communities in remote regions .
It destroys business opportunities on both sides of the Atlantic and seriously harms good relations with important trade and strategic global partners. It destroys business opportunities on both sides of the Atlantic and seriously harms good relations with important trade and strategic global partners.
Furthermore, this proposal violates the WTO rules.
As deputies, we have the duty to protect people and create an environment for employment opportunities
With this ban, we are failing in both areas
slapping a ban on overpopulated seals is a madness and a complete failure of our values.
to all MEPs, please stop this disaster and vote against this proposal.
for the credibility of the UPNU. I'm sorry.
The Economic Recovery Package We Will Vote On Is In Reality A Non-Recovery Plan Which Will Produce Almost No Immediate Economic Stimulus .
We have had months of sometimes intense negotiations with the EU Council.
Unfortunately, rather than standing up to those governments like Germany , Netherlands , UK , which adopted a short-sighted I-Wall -my-money-back - approach, the majority of this house , the Ethiopian Commission have simply caved in to their demands.
This outcome is very bad and it could have been avoided
We could have built real solidarity instruments where the vast majority of the funds would have gone to those economies mostly need our friends in Eastern Europe.
we could have enhanced the economic effectiveness of this package by using innovative finance instruments like loan guarantee funds and the public banks like the U.P. Investment Bank
And this would have transformed 5 billion Euro into 50 to 80 billion in investments which we need at this moment for the European economy
We could have had focused our investments on those areas with immediate job creation . Like cities in Europe investing in
renovation of buildings and public transport, like independent power companies investing in renewables, like our industries in Europe investing in equal technologies.
Instead, you have decided to concentrate the bulk of these 5 billion , in old-fashioned state aid , to those least in need of cash . The big energy oligopolies of UK, Germany and France. .
Instead of sending a strong signal , we send a signal of lack of political courage. Spinal as you pin institutions to cave in to the whims of nationally blink ered governments. .
Unfortunately, we have no brave and visionary commissioner . President
Unfortunately, the Liberates and the Socialists in the House were not ready to fight with the Greens for to make this recovery plan . . . a real first step to a Green New Deal.
Before change can happen in Europe we must change the president of commission
In order to make this change happen, we need to change the majorities in the European Parliament.
Step there is no need to do this is more than ever the right slogan for the upcoming European elections
Mr President, I rise on Mr Hoppenstadt's report to give the Budget Committee's opinion.
Mr Hoppenstatt, this will be my last speech before this chamber after twenty years.
The Budget Committee recognises the importance of these proposals and the urgency ,
them, it's quite clear that some key EU policy will be undermined without proper financing. Therefore, we are happy to support the proposal.
However, we would point out that because this money is coming from the margin of heading 1A, that will reduce the margin and therefore reduce the availability of funding for other projects which may be important in the future
we should bear that in mind
Secondly, we should also ensure that these organisations do not in any way become agencies , because if they did they would be subject to the inter-institutional agreement on agencies. .
Finally, we would not want the Budget Committee's position to be in any way undermined by the rush for these proposals
That is why the Budget Committee was happy to support Mr McCreevey's proposal on Monday night about interim funding so that we can ensure that proper financial procedures and a proper trialogue take place on the financial implication of these proposals
Thank you very much President. After 15 years this will be my last speech in the European Parliament and I think there are few more important issues than the whole question of asylum and how European countries face this challenge.
There's no easy response to this issue either
If there was, some country would have found it by now.
In reality, I would suggest that the only way to reduce the number of desperate people who seek refuge or asylum in a country other than their own is to address the root causes that force them to leave their homes and country of origin
That is why it is so important, colleagues, that we in the EU and in all developed democratic countries offer advice, help and support including financial support to those countries that are affected by war , internal violence , lack of human rights or discrimination
Equally, we have to address the poverty around the world which contributes to migratory pressures
We should never condemn people who are forced to seek asylum or refugee status
Instead, we should offer sympathy and offer our support
That today, colleagues, is our challenge. Thank you, President.
Dear President, Madam Commissioner, Colleagues, as the situation in Iran escalates, and the violations of democracy present also a danger to whole regional stability, we have to express our concern and condemnation by declaring that declarations cannot be only symbolic and empty.
Some European leaders are talking about new sanctions to be imposed on Iran, but the discussion is needed. Right now, on the promotion of the democracy at the grassroots level in this country. Right now,
I am Polish and we in Eastern Europe know how important are these type of actions for the establishment of democracy. Thank you.
A promotion should be adapted to political and economic situation in a given country but previously EU experience in the promotion of democracy in North Africa , Middle East and Eastern Europe ,
have to be reviewed and evaluated in order to see what should be done in Iran, what can be done in Iran and what is effective under given circumstances in this country.
I also want to remind you that if you want to be credible it has also to undertake some measures in Moldova
soon we will face a new test on the 29th of July elections in Moldova
EU have to do everything to ensure a free and fair democratic elections in this country
It is not enough to talk about the support for democracy. We in European Parliament and European institutions have to be more active in that respect. We have to be more active in that respect.
I want to raise the case of Mr. John Zafiropoulos who is imprisoned in Greece
His family, who are my constituents, are convinced of His innocence
At the beginning of this year I wrote to the Minister of Justice in Athens raising the case.
I didn't get a reply. So in a one minute speech here in May in this hemicycle I raised the question
Immediately after I'd spoken the Greek permanent representation rushed to my office and promised me an immediate reply from the minister in person.
Four months later... Nothing.
if the Greek permanent representation is listening to us now in the hemicycle I would like to express my surprise and dismay that nothing has happened
Would they please get me a reply from the minister and look at the case of Mr. John Zafiropoulos again?
Commissioner, as one of the reporters on FTA with South Korea and a strong FTA protagonist, I'm hoping for balance and level playing field agreement that benefits both sides. True win-win's future. Thank you.
One of our core industry is not really happy with current status of negotiation and they have many friends in their camp including some member states, industries and any MEPs
They all see playing field unfairly tilted to benefit South Korea in this agreement
European Commission and European Council should look hard into areas of friction namely a DDT , safeguard clause, non-carriage barriers and rules of origin
If some progress could be achieved to bring more satisfaction to EU car industry, then employment levels, strong GDP and expected standard of living would really benefit and be preserved
On the other hand level playing field will not be only disadvantage
Strong precedent may be established for RFTA waiting in line and coming up soon in the near future.
It is clear to me this agreement overall bring other benefits to the EU and to some of EU different industries. I think it is clear to me that this agreement overall bring other benefits to the EU and to some of EU different industries.
In small picture, there always will be some winners and losers. It is the nature of any bilateral agreement.
In big picture, we could be close to real balance
But having such a crucial industry such as automobile in fairly unhappy mode there is a need to try for more
Only when achieving some additional progress can we speak of truly balanced FTA that is acceptable and has real positive impact as precedent for a future FTA
The resolution of the visa regime for the Western Balkan countries is important as this measure matters to the most. To the ordinary citizens in the region and it will clearly show the benefits of the EU rapprochement process.
I am confident that the conditional inclusion of the white list of Albania and both near and dear to God will prove to be a strong incentive for meeting the rest of the benchmarks on the roadmap .
In our case, back to 2001, it had been sent such a strong signal and in a couple of months we managed to fulfill all pending conditions
It is essential that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina are included on the Schengen white list as soon as possible and the Commission should provide all the necessary technical assistance. To the Commission, the Commission should provide all the necessary technical assistance to the authorities of these two countries in order to meet in a short while the necessary conditions. Thank you.
for the G20 concentrate on measures for the financial sector.
However, everyone seems to forget that also the real economy suffers from greed and obsession for short-term profits
I have deep respect for small enterprises who against all odds try to survive
They deserve to get the loans to which they are entitled
However, I have no respect at all for the management of some of the bigger companies who have no affinity with the products or services they deliver and can only think in terms of expansion and spectrification. Thank you.
I therefore call upon the G20 to discuss ways of making the economy more democratic. How to make sure that within the company workers and others who represent a general interest have enough power to control the management.
Within the EU, we have to look again at the statute for a European company.
We should make sure that it becomes impossible for shareholders and managers to engage in speculative growth strategies to the detriment of the long-term interests of the companies themselves and of those who work for their companies. Thank you.
The majority of Europeans are not corporate leaders and not bankers but family farmers , small entrepreneurs , state employees. And
the majority of Europe is completely fed up with the present system in which global multinational corporations and banks rule the world. And
They need and they want a fundamentally new paradigm , a new paradigm in which there must be a shift from globalization to localization , from a completely profit and
money-centered decision-making. To a human -centered and community-centered decision-making. To a human-centered and community-centered decision-making. From a WTO, ruled free trade agriculture to food sovereignty and local production and local farming. And
Please do not fail to represent at the G20 summit the view of the majority of Europe. Thank you.
because the issue of energy supplies security is of promoting importance to the fall among the states of European Union.
