Madam President, are only greed, euphoria and cheap money to be blamed for the whole mess?
What about the flaws of the originate-and-distribute model, which has enhanced systemic risk?
What about skewed pay schemes with a lack of ethics, which have stimulated reckless risk-taking?
What about investment-grade values assigned to trash?
What about conflicts of interest?
What about banks engaging in casino-type transactions?
What about the ‘ shadow ’ banking sector, with its extreme leveraging and speculation?
Why have policymakers not learnt from previous crises, though stern warnings were sent?
Just remember what Lamfalussy, Gramlich, Volcker and Buffett said years ago.
The argument that regulation stifles financial innovation I find ludicrous.
Not all financial innovation is sound.
Is a quasi-international Ponzi scheme, as it has been developing via toxic products during the past decade, to be tolerated?
The issue at stake is the lack of proper regulation and supervision, and a poor understanding of financial markets, of the way they function and of systemic risk.
Free markets are not synonymous with deregulated markets.
Correction is going to be very painful, especially in the United States, but Europe is not immune to economic downturn.
Solutions should not be patchy – consider that markets are global.
International coordination is needed to restore confidence.
Madam President, the financial crisis rages on and euro-zone countries are facing recession.
The answer, we are repeatedly told, is that we need more regulation to make the financial sector work better.
But we have a problem now, and changing the rules after the problem has arisen is not going to help us with that problem.
I urge Members to consider a completely different reaction to the current economic difficulties.
They are a signal that we cannot continue as we are and that, thanks to borrowing that has been too cheap and imports that have been too cheap, we have all been living above our means and we cannot go on consuming at the same rate.
Adjustment will be painful, but it is necessary, and in these hard times there is another message that is even more salient but will not be heard in these institutions.
It is that the EU cannot continue with its massive legislative programmes in the name of health and safety, consumer protection, social equality, for instance, for the overriding effect of all these schemes is to add costs and to crush the productive activity on which our very prosperity depends.
In these hard times, the one message that should be heard is that European countries can no longer afford the European Union, its institutions and its immense outpourings of legislation.
Mr President, this crisis has demonstrated that the global financial system is seriously flawed.
First the supervisory agencies failed to prevent irresponsible behaviour by investors.
We have seen the development of new financial instruments that are, however, not transparent enough and do not allow for proper risk assessment.
Secondly, owners and shareholders of financial institutions failed to supervise properly their own managers, who paid themselves exorbitant salaries and bonuses, and for what?
For driving their companies into bankruptcy! We need urgent action at least in these two areas.
We do not want a repetition of the American meltdown scenario in Europe.
We do not want in Europe a situation in which chief executive officers of financial companies go away with tens of millions of dollars while taxpayers are left to pay their bills.
We expect the Commission to take serious action on this.
Mr President, there are going to be radical changes in the way the EU produces and consumes its energy.
This has been based on a three-pronged strategy by the Commission: security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness.
But the Commission left out a fundamental part of this important debate, namely the issue of affordability.
Since the publication of the Green Paper on energy, Socialists in this Parliament have been asking for consumers to be put right back into the driving seat.
We want to see energy poverty as a part of this debate.
So far in the EU there are no national definitions and there is no data collection, so we have no idea of the scale of this problem.
We know that energy prices have been rising exponentially and they are hitting the most vulnerable in our society the hardest.
I would like to give fair warning to the Council that, in the negotiations on the electricity and gas directives that we are about to begin, the issue of energy poverty will be fundamental to our agreement.
We are not going to step on your toes.
We are asking for domestic action on this – not Community action – but we do expect action for the poorest people in the EU on energy poverty.
Sometimes a question flies away, and this is perhaps a bit obsolete, I must admit, but I thank the Commission for giving such a fair answer.
My appeal, and my worry, is that we are over-reacting, and I hope the Commission could consider that.
I agree that we should act and react, but we should not overdo it, because we need a balanced approach.
Otherwise – and I think that is something we should consider in the long term – we could harm growth in Europe.
So, I think, a balanced approach; and I rely on the Commission to ensure these measures are implemented in an appropriate way.
Commissioner, I would like to ask you once more about our famous Ignalina atomic plant.
Recently our Prime Minister met the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, and in our papers there were some interpretations that there is a gap; there is a possibility of prolonging the work of this station.
What is your opinion, and what would you recommend to the Lithuanian Government in this situation?
Madam President, the resolution on the situation in Belarus reveals what Brussels and Minsk could do in order not to lose the momentum for improving their relations.
I support the approach taken by Jan Marinus Wiersma, which also mirrors the stance taken by the Belarusian opposition of Alexander V. Kazulin and Alexander Milinkevich.
The policy of the EU, to punish Belarus and the Belarusians for the actions of their regime, did not achieve the envisaged results.
It is necessary to open all gates for people-to-people contacts, and bring down visa barriers which are contradictory to common sense.
Providing Minsk is really willing to improve cooperation with the EU, this should create more favourable conditions for the kick-off of mutual discussions, not only externally but also domestically.
It can be done by starting talks on the political, economic, social and human rights issues involving all political parties, opposition forces, NGOs and trade unions.
Mr President, we are currently receiving conflicting signals from Minsk, and this is already some kind of progress in relation to before, but the recent parliamentary election reinforced the popular Western image of Belarus as a kind of banana republic.
On the other hand, the recent release of political dissidents is a welcome development.
If it is an attempt by Lukashenko to reach out to the West, let us reward his efforts with our cautious support.
But we should be under no illusions about the widespread abuses of human rights and political freedoms in Belarus.
Our focus must be the people and civil society of Belarus – a cause that this House has a noble and vital tradition of supporting, even more so after today ’ s speech by Ingrid Betancourt.
The people of Belarus yearn to take their place in the new Europe.
They need to know that we care and that we will not ignore them.
Like the minister, I have no wish to make Europe into a fortress, and I want sensible security checks and to use new technology.
But I have witnessed the use of these passports, and I wonder if he can tell me where I am going wrong, because what happens is a person in possession of an electronic passport comes up to a machine, places his or her passport on the reader and then walks through if the passport is in order.
I cannot see how that is doing anything other than checking whether that person is in possession of a valid passport.
What it is not doing is checking that the person has one that has been issued in his or her name.
My understanding, therefore, is that there would be nothing to stop me using your passport, Minister – providing you were to lend it to me – to go through a check, because there is nobody there to see whether the picture and the person is the same, or I could be using the passport of a distinguished person like Mr McMillan-Scott.
I wonder if you can give me an assurance as to where the check is actually taking place concerning the ownership and the actual identity of the person.
Mr President, I share in the delight of my friend and colleague, Ms Gill, that we are closing loopholes in this directive.
Timeshare is a big industry, but it also can be a big scam.
For example, I have been dealing with a company called the European Timeshare Owners Organisation, which operates in Spain – but conveniently from an address in Gibraltar – and constituents have told me that they were approached by this company which offered to resell their timeshare.
When they went to Spain at great expense, they found there was nobody to buy their timeshare, but this company wanting to sell them other timeshares.
I have been trying to get in touch with this company for several weeks and only finally this week managed to do so, because, miraculously, the phone numbers they give do not have people at the other end to answer – and they do not seem to respond to letters either.
I hope that we will start now to crack down on organisations like the European Timeshare Owners Organisation, because they give timeshare a bad name and, frankly, they damage the image of the Spanish holiday industry, which I know you care so much about.
Mr President, Parliament defends individuals and small organisations, small businesses, as opposed to governments who want to sweep away inconvenient things and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection feels very strongly that the external land-border shops should be allowed to remain.
They should be better policed, as should all the policing against crime across borders in Europe be much better, but it is not a reason to sweep them away.
Secondly, on sea and air travel, the Internal Market Committee believes strongly that travellers – based on their final destination, as opposed to a transit destination – should be allowed to buy duty-free because that would help small regional airports generate revenue.
It may be inconvenient to the governments, but we defend it very strongly.
The third and final point that I want to make – which it is very regrettable that the Commission did not include in its 2006 consultation on this legislation – is the removal of these exemptions which it is now proposing.
Why did it not include it?
Why did it not carry out an impact assessment on what it would mean before it proposed it?
Mr President, it seems as though Conservatives and Socialists are hand in glove with each other on the Blue Card, leaving my group lost in amazement, to be honest.
For a while now, the EU has been trying to come up with a comprehensive package on migration, including measures to tackle illegal migration as well as measures to push Europe ’ s forward-looking strategy on legal migration.
You might remember the very emotional debate on the Return Directive.
At the time, the ALDE Group said that the return policy could not be looked upon in an isolated way: it should be seen as an integral part – a necessary part – of a total package for migration, which is still very true.
Today, we finally have the chance to give a strong message on the need for better opportunities for legal migration, to address the demands of businesses in urgent need of qualified workers.
The fact that we could not expect too much from the EPP on legal migration is unfortunate but could, in a way, be foreseen.
The fact that the PSE is, broadly speaking, happily in line with the EPP on the Blue Card amendments makes my hair stand on end.
Following the vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the scheme has been watered down significantly.
Far too many restrictions have been introduced, which do not help in any way when trying to make the EU more attractive to highly qualified workers.
It must be clear that the intention of the Blue Card is to increase the competitiveness of the EU economy.
The Blue Card proposal is not an easy attempt to take the best and leave the rest, thereby creating a brain drain from developing countries.
The current trend is that the vast majority of the highly qualified workers emigrate to the US, Canada or Australia instead of the EU.
If we want to reverse this trend, we have to be ambitious.
This House is about to adopt a report that would weaken an already very modest Commission proposal even further.
To be clear, the ALDE Group is a very strong supporter of the Blue Card.
However, we feel that the current text does not bring about the much-needed change for legal migration but that it confirms Member States ’ protectionist practices instead.
We all know that the Council has been excellent in making ambitious statements, but we also know that, too often, effective decision making is constrained by the inability of the Member
States to really work together in their mutual interest, and that effective decision making in this field is being undermined by a very emotional and muddled debate on legal migration, owing to a lack of focus.
The Tampere Programme, the Hague Programme, the French immigration pact, the Stockholm Programme coming up – at the end of the day, it all comes down to the transposition of these basic commitments into concrete and effective measures.
If we want the EU to benefit from the proposed scheme, we have to be ambitious and therefore I hope you will vote accordingly tomorrow.
Madam President, ever since I had the honour of drafting the report on combating HIV / AIDS within the EU and neighbouring countries, I have been very committed to this issue, with all its implications and ramifications, of people living with HIV.
One year ago, in the framework of the conference ‘ HIV in Europe 2007 ’, participants developed a comprehensive call to action on measures regarding how to effectively tackle HIV / AIDS in Europe.
Some elements of this call are now also reflected in this joint motion for a resolution.
The aim of this resolution is to contribute to the fight against HIV / AIDS on a political level.
Therefore, it calls on the Council and the Commission to formulate a comprehensive strategy on HIV to promote early diagnosis, ensure early care and communicate the benefits of earlier care to all European citizens.
It calls on the Commission to commit substantial resources to deliver the above-mentioned strategy and asks Member States to step up information and education campaigns on prevention, testing and treatment.
I am aware that the Commission is planning to bring forward a new communication on combating HIV in the EU and the neighbourhood and also that Commissioner Vassiliou confirmed her personal commitment to take further action in this field.
To conclude, this situation needs to be urgently tackled.
Madam President, it is difficult to stand up now after that particularly lively debate and switch to another topic! I would like to stress that the good and consistent enforcement of environmental legislation is essential for its credibility, for a level playing field and for ensuring that the environmental objectives will be met.
The issue of environmental inspections is, therefore, very important for the work of my committee, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
On 14 November the Commission published the communication on environmental inspections in the Member States.
This communication reviewed Recommendation 2001 / 331 / EC of the European Commission, providing minimum criteria for environmental inspections.
The communication contains some worrying messages.
It states that the information submitted by the Member States on the implementation of the recommendation is incomplete or difficult to compare.
It states that there are still large differences in the way environmental inspections are being carried out in the EU.
It states that the scope of the recommendation is inadequate and that it does not include many important activities such as Natura 2000 and the control of illegal waste shipping.
It states that inspection plans have not been implemented and where they do exist that they are often not publicly available.
My committee noted with concern the conclusions from the Commission stating that the full implementation of the environmental legislation in the Community cannot be ensured.
This would not only lead to continuing damage to the environment, but also to the distortion of competition within and between the Member States.
My committee therefore formulated four questions to the Commission, which can be summarised as follows.
First, why does the Commission only wish to amend the recommendation – why does it not propose a directive on environmental inspections?
Second, why has the Commission opted instead for attaching environmental inspection requirements to existing directives individually, a process that will take a lot of time?
Third, why is the Commission not prepared to use a directive to define terms such as ‘ inspection ’ and ‘ audit ’, which are interpreted in different ways by Member States?
Fourth, why is the Commission not prepared to transform IMPEL into an effective EU environmental inspection force?
I would like to thank the Commission in advance for its reply and I would like to conclude by emphasising that, in my opinion, the implementation
and enforcement of environmental legislation should get the same political attention as the adoption of the legislation in the Commission, in the Council and in Parliament.
Unless we achieve a truly common stance in the EU in favour of real reform, achieving adequate global rules for the financial markets becomes much harder.
Sensible people would say that a massive failure of both regulation and oversight, together with revealed flaws of an overly simplistic economic paradigm, provide an indubitable answer to what to do.
But some still argue that soft regulations should be the norm of the new system.
In my view, they are wrong, whether they honestly think so or are driven by parochial interests.
One of Keynes ’ intellectual legacies – that highly volatile capital flows are inimical to trade and prosperity – has shown its relevance in the current huge mess and other crises, including in emerging markets.
For decades now a mantra has been heard worldwide: that not much can be done in national policy-making because global markets would punish a government.
But is the complexion of global financial markets God-given?
Are not global markets, aside from their technological drivers, also the product of human beings ’ decisions to set rules for finance, trade and investment?
The claim that nothing can be done about finance, when it brings about misery, is unconvincing.
Much can be done in regulating all financial entities (including hedge funds and private equity funds), constraining leverage, dealing with pro-cyclicality and accounting, coordinating policies better, dealing with the rating agencies.
The decline of a paradigm which equates market economies with no regulations has to be seen in conjunction with a rising multi-polar economic world in the attempt to forge a new international financial system.
On the latter hinges the fate of an open world economic system.
Unless we do the right things now, we run the risk of crippling our liberal democracies.
I hope that the new American administration will be forthcoming in this respect.
But we at home in Europe have to rise to the momentousness of this period.
Mr President, the gas crisis has left hundreds of thousands of households across 17 European countries without heating during freezing temperatures.
Eastern and central Europe have been affected the most by the dispute, which has shut down factories and schools.
Even if Kiev and Moscow sign the EU-brokered deal after hours of talks with EU officials, Gazprom says that the deal to restart gas supplies to Europe via Ukraine will be delayed as it has not received a copy of the agreement.
The team of technical experts sent by the European Commission will check flows into Ukrainian pipelines from Russia and, even if the gas starts to flow in Ukraine, it may take about 36 hours to reach EU Member States.
As a result, Europe needs a single policy on energy security in order to avoid future conflicts and it needs to diversity its sources of energy supplies.
I welcome the intervention of Parliament in the dispute and hope that an agreement will be reached as soon as possible in order to avoid a deepening conflict.
Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mr Lambsdorff for the excellent work he has done and of course his shadows, particularly, Mrs Cederschiöld, but let me also underline something that Mr Toubon said: the fantastic work done by the French presidency in achieving agreement on this directive.
I hope that when we return to it in a few years ’ time we will realise that we should not have been afraid to talk about a European defence equipment market because of a common European market.
It is in the common defence interest of Europe and it is in the common interest of Europe to have more competition.
Let me highlight one part of this directive which is highly important for many Member States. This is particularly the text concerning subcontracting.
I am very happy that the agreements reached with the Council and the Commission on the text concerning subcontracting have reflected to a large extent what Parliament has been pushing for, namely that there is more transparency in terms of subcontracting; secondly,
that there is no discrimination on a national basis when subcontracts are being drafted and finally that national authorities have the ability to allow contractors to subcontract up to 30% of their contracts.
This is in the interests of bringing our industry together across Europe.
Mr President, today we have just voted on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union.
It is with great regret that, together with my two Maltese colleagues in the PSE Group, we have had to abstain from voting on the report.
Although the report refers to numerous issues of fundamental human rights which are laudable, it includes other issues, such as abortion, which should never have been included in this report.
As the Maltese social representatives in the European Parliament are against abortion, we have had to vote against these particular parts of the report.
There are, indeed, other issues included in this report, such as living wills and the right to dignity at the end of life, which are sensitive issues, regarding which we have had to abstain.
That is why we abstained at the end of this vote.
I would like to thank you for this opportunity.
Mr President, for all those who observe the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this might be a time in which we are tempted to put our hands in the air and scream in despair.
I do not think we should, however, because I think the greatest test of our humanity today is to really understand the issues at hand.
The first issue is that there can be no lasting solution to this conflict without stopping the bombardment of Israel.
The second issue is that there cannot be a lasting solution to this conflict without opening Gaza to humanitarian aid.
Indeed, President Peres has been absolutely right in saying that Gaza should be open for aid and not enclosed for rockets.
I think this is quintessential, and everyone agrees to this.
There cannot be a return to the status quo ante, and I think we could do a number of things here.
Firstly Parliament can bring both sides together to talk; secondly we should stand behind the Commission and the Council and support their efforts; and finally we should firmly support the Egyptian track of negotiations, because that is the only track that can lead to a solution and to the ceasefire which we currently all hope for.
Madam President, I am glad to see Mr Vondra back.
I thank him for explaining the gravity of the situation, but when is the Council going to learn that until the EU speaks with one voice on energy issues, in particular in relation to Russia and the Ukraine, we are going to be in a weak position?
I am going to give you an example where the Council does not do that.
We shall shortly be starting negotiations on the second reading of the energy liberalisation package.
The Commission came up with a very carefully crafted position on third countries investing in the EU, suggesting that the Commission speak on behalf of the EU on these issues.
What have you in the Council done?
You have retreated to national positions and said, no – we Member States we want the final say, not the Commission.
It is this divide-and-rule, the oldest trick in the book, which you and your fellow colleagues have fallen for.
Until you understand that pooling your powers to gain more leverage internationally is the way to go, we will always be in a position where we are vulnerable.
You must answer the European citizens as to why they are now sitting in the cold.
You have to change your position on this line.
Will you do so?
Mr President, the Horn of Africa is a dreadful region where internal and regional conflicts continue to undermine peace and security.
They create humanitarian disasters and paralyse the development of this strategically significant region.
Each war, each conflict accentuates the fragility of the states.
At the heart of most of these conflicts is the lack of leadership and democratic governments rightly put forward in the report of the EP delegation.
What this region needs is home-grown democratisation, respect for national and international rule of law and above all national reconciliation.
About Somalia, I would like to emphasise that the resignation of former president Yusuf and the withdrawal of Ethiopian forces creates a huge window of opportunity.
The time has come to pick up the pieces and bring about intra-Somali peace.
The Somali Parliament is a crucial factor for confidence-building and can make the peace process all-inclusive.
Furthermore, it is imperative that the EU supports the renewal and strengthening of an African Union Peace Force.
This force needs a decent UN mandate.
If not, Ugandan and Burundian forces will pull away from Mogadishu leaving a security gap behind.
I entirely agree with Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
There is a momentum for change now in Somalia that should be taken advantage of.
The power as well as the security vacuum must be filled.
If not, the stateless chaos known as Somalia will remain.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Parish on bringing this forward.
Despite our political differences, and notwithstanding his very obvious deficiencies as a human being, I think he is actually very sound on this and I support him.
We need this regulation to be a success and we need it to be universally in force, but I have a number of reservations and I disagree with some colleagues who spoke this morning.
Mr Stevenson said that longer journeys were unavoidable – I say: not so.
Mrs Jensen spoke of 24-hours transport – not necessarily.
Mr Allister, the agricultural industry has to ask questions itself.
As a civilised society, we need to look at the whole question, the whole purpose, the whole idea of transporting animals long distances and then killing them.
If I were a meat eater, I would be asking how can the suffering en route which we know about, the dehydration, the stress and – to our Irish colleagues North and South – the sea journeys, possibly improve the quality of the product at the end?
To my mind, it makes no economic sense.
It does not make humanitarian sense.
This is why I favour a complete ban on the transport of animals, which, I believe, would support rural economies.
It would encourage local producers, yes, small- and medium-sized enterprises as someone spoke of, and it would enable consumption of food as near the point of production as possible.
In the absence of that, and I know it is not going to happen in the near future, I think we need proper realistic enforcement of what we have at the moment, the regulation, and I urge the Commission to use all
the agencies across Europe – police forces on motorways if necessary – to stop and check lorries to see whether they are carrying out the full requirements of this legislation.
Mr President, you could have guessed what these reports would say.
We have got a problem and the European Union has got to give its opinion.
It has got to give the impression that it is in the driving seat to solve the problem.
So we have a European Economic Recovery Plan of which the car industry is a part.
But in reality each manufacturer is going to look after itself as best it can, and each country will look after its manufacturers as best it can.
There is of course a possible case for some support, some financial support to the car industry and other sectors to keep capital intact and to keep skills intact.
But this can only be decided at the national level because the support – apart from the European Investment Bank mentioned by Mr Verheugen – can only be provided by national taxpayers.
But there is one thing that the European Union could constructively do here, at least until the recession is over, and that is to give car manufacturers a break from environmental restrictions.
The industry is already in serious trouble.
These environmental and other standard restrictions make cars more expensive.
You are helping to kill off an industry which is already in serious bother.
Mr President, regarding the report on patients ’ rights in cross-border health care, I would like to emphasise the issue of the right of patients to be informed about the available medication and treatment options.
European patients should have access to quality health information regarding the latest medication available, the treatment options home and abroad, the legal and financial implications of being treated abroad, the reimbursement of the treatment costs and many other areas.
For the moment, we do not have this type of quality information.
We may have some national initiatives, but nothing that could be effective at European level.
The problems we face are European.
I therefore support the idea of setting up a European health literacy network.
Such a network should consist of patients ’ organisations from all the Member States and should work closely with the health sector and the policy makers.
In the hope of making the Commission aware of the need to better inform the 150 million European patients, I have initiated a written declaration on health literacy.
We have all been patients at some point, and we never know when it will happen again.
Madam President, I would like to refer this report back to committee under Rule 168 (2).
Both this democratically elected Parliament and the European Commission see the necessity to cover some modest forms of cooperation between the EU and developing countries, actions that are not strictly speaking poverty alleviation, such as exchange programmes between universities here and there.
The budget for development is not meant for this kind of cooperation, but some Members insist on using a legal base that would lead us to finance these actions with the development budget while that is precisely what we seek to avoid with this report.
We did not reach an agreement.
If Amendment 1 is adopted, then this report would become incoherent and contrary to the interests of the world ’ s poorest people.
I consider, therefore, that we should refer this report back to the Committee on Development in order to agree on a legal base having the support of a clear majority of this House.
Mr President, I welcome this report, with just one or two small reservations.
We have heard from my colleague, Mrs Gill, how important small businesses are to the economy and how they are bearing the brunt of the difficulties at the moment.
The trouble is that the European Union is geared entirely for big businesses, whether it is about legislation, access to markets or funding.
We often talk about better regulation, but what we really need is proportionality.
We have to ensure that our legislation is proportional to the problems we are dealing with, and particularly in the IPPC, which we have talked about today.
It is really about big business, not about small businesses, and we should reflect that.
I welcome initiatives like JASMINE, which I think are moving us in the right direction, but we need to think in terms of funding, market access and legislation and about the specific needs of small business.
Let me make one particular plea: we have a single market but we do not have a single Community patent.
We have been at this for years and years now, and it really is a disgrace that we cannot sort out this problem.
It could, by itself, be the biggest help for businesses in the European Union.
Let us have some action.
Madam President, I welcome the Commission Green Paper and its objective of increasing the visibility of the issues around the EU health workforce and identifying challenges and action that can be taken.
However, I wish to take the opportunity to emphasise one aspect of the Green Paper, namely the training of the health workforce.
I initiated Written Declaration 0095 / 2008 on this issue, which is ongoing.
I strongly support the idea that it is absolutely essential to develop training communication courses for the health workforce in order to provide clearer and more complete information to patients.
Patients ’ ability to understand health and medical issues and directions is closely related to the clarity of the communication.
Despite various initiatives to improve the quality and the availability of health information, studies indicate that patients want more information than they currently receive and that health professionals tend to overestimate the amount of information that is supplied.
Madam President, on Monday evening, the Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted a motion regarding the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka, pursuant to Rule 91.
The situation in Sri Lanka is clearly very serious, but exactly what is happening regarding the humanitarian situation is far from clear.
I am conscious that there are many differing views across this House.
So I suggest that the most sensible course of action would be to timetable a proper debate, which cannot seriously be fitted in in this part-session but could be in our next part-session, which is just 10 days away.
I am grateful to Mr Daul of the PPE-DE Group for indicating his group ’ s support for this course of action.
As we are a serious Chamber, I suggest and ask colleagues to support a debate with resolution and full participation at the next part-session, to do justice to the gravity of the situation in Sri Lanka.
Mr President, I would like to speak about a very important issue related to the European Prize for Literature.
The prize is financed by the Cultural Programme of the European Union, and it aims to put the spotlight on creativity in the field of contemporary fiction.
I think it is a very good initiative, but I have my concerns about its implementation.
I have been contacted by cultural organisations from my country that are unhappy because Romania is not included this year in the programme.
Indeed, out of 34 eligible countries, only 12 are included each year in this programme.
The legitimate question is how the remaining countries, including Romania, could take an active part if they are not included at all in the programme.
So I would like to bring this problem to your attention, and I hope we will find, together with the European Commission, a convenient way to settle this problem.
Mr President, what worries me most is the suggestion that the European Investment Bank (EIB) has a significant role to play in solving the financial crisis – that it can somehow act as the Europe-wide body to provide stimulus where Member States have singularly failed to coordinate their own stimuli.
The danger is that, if it expands its activities too far into supporting commercial banks and governments – as has been suggested – then its enviable high credit rating may be downgraded, like some of our governments.
The EIB has a leverage of about 35 times, and its shareholders are Member State governments.
It would be a serious issue if it were to go bust, like some of our commercial banks.
The report even encourages the EIB and the Commission to increase lending by experimenting with new innovative financial instruments.
I thought the world had seen enough of clever financial tricks.
Mr President, out of this budget review, we simply have to ask ourselves one question: does the budget reflect the political priorities of the 21st century?
If it does not, it needs changing.
Is it flexible enough to reflect changing times?
Because one of my frustrations at the moment with the budget is how we deal with negative priorities.
Too much is left in the budget because we cannot change things because of the restrictions of the MFF.
If I could turn to activity-based budgeting and management, I think the Commission has made huge progress on this but I would warn against over-bureaucratising this exercise because what we want to ensure is a qualitative evaluation, not simply ticking boxes.
We do not want people spending all their time evaluating themselves when they should be getting on and doing some work.
So we have got to be careful about that.
I personally think the annual policy strategy would be better if it was every two years or every two and a half years to fit in with the parliamentary cycle.
This would allow us to get a much clearer idea of our policy perspectives on top of the Commission ’ s annual work programmes.
Madam President, I speak on the van Nistelrooij report and to emphasise three points.
First, that territorial cohesion involves promoting polycentric development across the European Union.
This means eliminating disparities within, as well as between, regions.
There is consequently a need for improved spatial analysis and the development of indicators against which policies can be designed and their impact assessed.
Second, there must be an integrated approach, with measurement in advance of the effect that sectoral policies would have at regional levels and the achievement of greater synergy between them.
Certainly, such impact assessment could pre-empt certain problems, such as those posed by the electronic identification of sheep in Scotland.
Third, an integrated approach demands proper multilevel governance, involving all stakeholders in the design and implementation of strategies.
What the Commissioner has said in these respects has been very welcome, and I hope for great support for this excellent report.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the Czech Presidency for the successful summit.
I think the summit has come up with a number of important decisions, but at the same time I am of the opinion that we need more, and we need to move faster.
When we go to the G20 meeting in London in a week ’ s time, I have the impression that we are still too integrated to act alone and too divided to act together.
I see three main priorities that we should focus on.
The first, of course, is jobs.
Millions of people in Europe are afraid of losing their jobs and, frankly, I do not understand the position of the French President in opposing the summit: a fully fledged summit is something we need at this moment.
Second, I am happy that we managed to eliminate – partly, at least – protectionist tendencies.
Nevertheless, they are still alive, and I think solidarity is the key.
The third point: the key is to restore confidence in the markets.
I am not even of the opinion that there is too little money in the market; I think there is enough money.
The problem is to transform this money into effective demand, and for that to happen we need to restore confidence among households and enterprises.
Madam President, Europe has a turbulent history with regard to totalitarianism and the restriction of basic freedoms.
In some parts of Europe the 20th century was hallmarked by such totalitarian regimes.
It is our moral obligation today to make sure that every citizen of the European Union enjoys the same rights.
It is highly important that the EU should also support the rights of minorities, especially since many countries all around the world do not respect very basic rights in this sense.
At the same time I would like to point out that, while the EU speaks out against discrimination and violation of human rights in cases like Tibet, it is clear to all of us that even within the European Union there are ethnic and linguistic minorities which are very often targets of cultural and linguistic assimilation.
This practice of some nation states in the EU is an aspect that should be seriously reviewed and reconsidered.
The Hungarians in Romania, the people I represent, are such a case.
Mr President, I am one of those people who would like to ensure the continuity of Internet freedom.
The creators of the Internet had great faith in the basic goodness of humankind, and I tend to share that faith.
Unfortunately, very often with the Internet, just as in any human society, we have to face the sad fact that regulations are needed to make sure that those who cannot protect themselves are protected too.
The safety of an individual is a fundamental right, just as much as the right to free speech and to self-expression.
Abominations such as child pornography and paedophilia, as well as Internet fraud, must be stopped.
We cannot tolerate Internet predators of any kind, and while we are discussing this topic of great interest I would like to draw your attention to a much less discussed fact: the
Internet is also full of sites that incite hatred, violence and intolerance towards all kinds of minorities, among them ethnic minorities.
It is an aspect of the Internet that needs our attention.
We have to make sure that minorities also feel protected.
It is unacceptable that many extremist groups use the Internet to instigate hatred and xenophobia.
− Madam President, this energy package is the culmination of years of hard work in which Parliament can be very proud of the changes that will now be put in place.
We should, in particular, be proud of the fact that the EU ’ s energy consumers have now been put right at the centre of the energy debate for the first time and the issue of energy poverty has now been recognised at European level.
The inherit conflict of interests that arises when a company owns both transmission and generation of electricity has been addressed, and the regulatory regime governing the energy markets has been strengthened.
The Electricity Directive, for which I was rapporteur, is part of a package of five measures which seeks improvements in the way the electricity and gas markets work across the continent, to ensure that the markets are better integrated and operate in a fairer and less discriminatory way.
Let me say how grateful I have been for the enormous cooperation from the other rapporteurs on this package, as well as from the shadows, the Commission and the Czech Presidency, for helping us to come to a conclusion on what was sometimes a very challenging debate.
The legislation has seen a raft of new consumer protection measures set out, including ensuring that customers are able to switch suppliers within three weeks, the provision in each Member State of an independent and robust complaints system, and the right to compensation if service levels are not met.
This legislation will also ensure that every household in the EU will be fitted with so-called ‘ smart meters ’ by 2022.
These smart meters will enable customers to better control their energy use and increase energy efficiency, helping to cut energy costs and reduce carbon emissions.
On the European Parliament ’ s initiative, the new legislation also includes special protection measures for vulnerable energy consumers, and the issue of energy poverty will now have to be taken seriously for the first time.
I would like to ask Commissioner Piebalgs if he will now make a commitment that, in future, the energy framework of the EU, in addition to addressing
security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness, will also now add a fourth leg – that of affordability – to all future energy policy proposals.
An EU-backed report has recently concluded that up to 125 million citizens are affected by energy poverty.
Member States now must take appropriate measures which could lead to the prevention of hundreds – if not thousands – of deaths in the poorest households across the continent.
We will also see the end to discriminatory pricing on prepayment meters.
The most controversial part of the package centred on whether there was a need for full ownership unbundling in the energy markets – in other words, a total separation of transmission systems from generation.
The market structure in some Member States means that the monopoly enjoyed by transmission system operators, who also own the means of generating electricity, offers no incentive to encourage other players onto the market, thereby undermining competition.
Parliament has now accepted a compromise that will allow ownership of both transmission and generation on condition that we see increased checks and balances to ensure the removal of the inherent conflict of interest that arises.
Many of us reluctantly accepted the compromise because we believe that the wind is blowing in the direction of wholesale separations, and these integrated companies are likely to separate regardless of this directive.
The Commission ’ s efforts in exposing the abuses of some companies is starting to pay off, with examples of companies like E. ON and RWE agreeing to sell their transmission networks following anti-trust investigations.
We are also going to see a strengthening of national regulatory authorities.
I would like to thank everybody for their cooperation, and I think we should be proud of what we have done for the consumers of the EU.
Mr President, beyond congratulating Mr Romeva i Rueda on his report, I would like to address the content in the wider context of the common fisheries policy.
In the last 10 years I have heard many criticisms of it, including the lack of a level playing field, insufficient stakeholder involvement, inadequate balancing of economic, social and environmental imperatives and too much by way of micro-management from the centre.
Recently, though, I have been able to assure people that the policy is undergoing significant change.
Of course there is still a long way to go – eliminating discards, for example – and there are times when the Commission still seems to veer towards micro-management.
I mention here Article 47 of the control regulation, at least in its original version.
I have often said, though, that the common fisheries policy is a bit like an oil tanker: it takes a considerable time to turn round, and I do believe that the control regulation will go a long way to achieving the
necessary level playing field where enforcement and sanctions are concerned, just as the development of regional advisory councils shall do much to bring improvements in other respects.
So I would like to finish on a personal note, by expressing my appreciation of the valuable work done by members of the Fisheries Committee throughout and by thanking Commissioner Borg and his team for all that has been achieved in their five years at the helm.
Mr President, Parliament has moved from its first-reading position on the Electricity and Gas Directive.
I would just like briefly to explain why.
The report as it stands is far from perfect, but we believe that we have made substantial gains for energy consumers in the European Union.
We have put the issue of energy poverty onto the European agenda for the very first time and we have ensured the independence of the national regulatory authorities and given them an increased role to police the new system.
We would like, however, to encourage the Commission and, in particular, the competition authorities to continue their work in ensuring that companies that own both generation and transmission systems play by the rules and do not abuse their positions.
I would like to thank colleagues for all their help over the years.
Madam President, I am glad that, in the end, common sense has prevailed in Parliament and the Commission concerning the causes of this financial crisis.
People have realised that this crisis is not of a cyclical nature and that a thorough overhaul of the regulation and supervision of financial markets is badly needed.
The de Larosière group report and the Turner report, too, have made this quite clear.
These reports are in analytical tune with the Lamfalussy follow-up report of Parliament.
The documents which are being debated today are to be seen in the same logic of action.
Unfortunately, our economies will still suffer for quite a while, not least because of the public budgets and, probably, future inflationary facts of the efforts which are being undertaken to clean up the huge mess.
Let us hope that we will learn more this time than we have from previous episodes of crisis.
Mr President, I want to congratulate both our rapporteurs.
A couple of years ago I was the rapporteur for access for disabled passengers to aeroplanes.
This legislation is another piece in the jigsaw to make transport as inclusive as possible or, as our colleague Mr Albertini put it, to consolidate passenger rights.
In an age when we are encouraging people to travel by public transport, it is so important that we add coaches and buses, as Mr Albertini has, to this field.
Some Members, not necessarily those here today, have looked for ways to make exemptions to exclude certain sections, but I have always taken as my starting point the desire to include as much as possible in this so we move towards making Europe more of a common market for people.
That is why Amendment 81 is so important.
The Commissioner in his remarks said we need the same rights for all passengers with no exceptions – and then he spoke about the exceptions, for example for regional transport.
I do not think we should exempt regional transport, and I have done some research.
In some of our Member States a regional coach journey can take up to six hours, which is longer than an international coach journey from, say, London to Brussels or Paris.
So I think it should be included.
I think it is right that, where local transport – as Mr Jarzembowski has referred to – is not included, there are public service contracts which mean that the companies will reach the same sort of standards.
I also think we need to persuade the construction industry to build more modern buses with the needs of disabled people more in mind.
Just as we have campaigned for aeroplanes to be more accessible to disabled people, so we need, perhaps, coaches with wider gangways or more accessible toilets, and we need the operating companies to make their coach terminals more accessible and to train their staff in disability and disability awareness issues.
This is a good report.
It is a good collection of reports, which takes us several steps forward, and I congratulate everyone who has been involved.
Mr President, the international community has been absolutely appalled at the information that we have all heard about the law that is being drafted in Afghanistan on the status of Shia women.
It is appalling to believe that, at the beginning of the 21st century, a country that wants to be a democracy and wants to abide by its international commitments can have a law that limits the rights of women.
However, I believe that in our debate, and in everything that we do with Afghanistan, we have to be very careful how we approach things, because Afghanistan is a country that has come through a violent,
repressive religious dictatorship; it has endured years and decades of civil war; it is a society in which people, more than buildings, have been hurt and destroyed.
We have to be very consistent in our messages, but we also have to be very careful in how we phrase those messages.
We should call on the Afghan authorities to take a look at the law, to revise it and make sure that it is entirely in line with the international commitments of that country, as well as its constitution.
We should not use this as an election opportunity here for us in Europe but as something that we can pass on to our colleagues and friends in Afghanistan to make sure that they can fulfil the obligations that they have voluntarily undertaken themselves.
In this case we have to assist President Karzai and the Government of Afghanistan in revisiting this law and making sure that it is in line with international commitments and the constitution.
It is part of our dialogue, and we have to be absolutely firm that no measures should be adopted that impede the rights of women.
I agree entirely with what Ana Maria Gomes has just said.
But let us be very careful because, when we deal with a society that has been so traumatised, it is far more important how our messages are heard there than how our messages are understood here.
Let us be very consistent in that and let us call on the Commission and the Council to pass on this message via all of our assistance programmes to the government and authorities in Afghanistan.
Mr President, the situation of Camp Ashraf, home to 3 500 members of the main democratic opposition of Iran, the PMOI, has been of great concern for some time and has been the subject of several resolutions in this House in recent years.
Together with a delegation of four Members of this House, I visited Camp Ashraf in October last year and met with American, Iraqi and UN officials there.
They all reinforced our concern for the legal status of Ashraf ’ s residents, because its security was transferred from American troops to Iraqi forces at the beginning of this year.
The situation has got much worse since then.
The Iranian supreme leader, in an official announcement at the end of February, asked the visiting Iraqi President to implement the mutual agreement to close down Camp Ashraf and expel all its residents from Iraq.
Since then Iraqi forces have started a siege around the camp.
Iraqi troops have been preventing entry of families of Ashraf residents, parliamentary delegations, human rights organisations, lawyers, journalists and even doctors to the camp, and do not allow many logistical materials to get into Ashraf.
This Parliament therefore found it absolutely necessary to address this as an urgency issue at this stage.
We have now worked together with all groups and produced a common text, which is well balanced and addresses all our concerns on this matter, and calls on international bodies to find a long-term legal status for Ashraf residents.
Unfortunately there are some amendments tabled by some of the spokesmen for Tehran, those who believe the lies told by Tehran.
I think we should understand clearly that these are contrary to the security of the residents of Ashraf and we should vote against them.
We urge all colleagues to stick to the joint text and reject any amendments.
Mr President, on behalf of one of my constituents I want to raise the case of a young man with dual British / Greek nationality named John Zafiropoulos.
Last year he was convicted by a first-degree Greek court to serve an unconscionably severe sentence in prison in Greece.
From the information I have been given, Mr President, I consider that the crucial rules relating to Greek legislation, as well as the provisions for fair trials, have been violated.
These fair trial provisions are defined by all of Europe and are the rights of every European citizen.
At the start of this year I wrote to the Greek Minister of Justice in Athens to alert him to my concerns.
The response which I received, three months later, was signed by minor Ministry employees and made no reference to the matter which I had raised with the Minister – in other words, the breaking of the rules about fair trials.
I am very concerned about this, Mr President, and for this reason I am raising it in Parliament right now, hoping that Athens will both send me a proper reply and deliver a full and fair review of the case of Mr Zafiropoulos.
Madam President, this final proposal on seal hunting is wholly unacceptable as it grossly interferes with other countries ’ affairs.
Yet these countries play by the rules and all they are trying to achieve is to manage natural resources and provide employment for their people.
This proposal destroys people ’ s lives and their communities in remote regions.
It destroys business opportunities on both sides of the Atlantic and seriously harms good relations with important trade and strategic global partners.
Furthermore this proposal violates WTO rules.
As Members of Parliament we have a duty to protect people and create an environment for employment opportunities.
With this ban we are failing in both areas.
Slapping a ban on overpopulated seals is madness and a complete failure of our values.
I say to all MEPs: please stop this disaster and vote against this proposal.
Madam President, this is a sad day for the credibility of the European Union.
The economic recovery package we will vote on is, in reality, a non-recovery plan which will produce almost no immediate economic stimulus.
We have had months of sometimes intense negotiations with the EU Council.
Unfortunately, rather than standing up to those governments like Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, which adopted a short-sighted ‘ I want my money back ’ approach, the majority of this House and the Commission have simply caved in to their demands.
This outcome is very bad and it could have been avoided.
We could have built a real solidarity instrument, where the vast majority of the funds would have gone to those economies most in need: our friends in eastern Europe.
We could have enhanced the economic effectiveness of this package by using innovative finance instruments, like loan guarantee funds and the public banks, or the European Investment Bank.
This would have transformed the EUR 5 billion into EUR 50-80 billion in investment, which we need at this moment for the European economy.
We could have focused our investments on those areas with immediate job creation, such as cities in Europe investigating in
the renovation of buildings and public transport, or independent power companies investing in renewables, or our industries in Europe investing in eco-technologies.
Instead, you have decided to concentrate the bulk of these EUR 5 billion on old-fashioned state aid to those least in need of cash: the big energy oligopolies in the UK, Germany and France.
Instead of sending a strong signal, we are sending a signal of a lack of political courage: spineless European institutions that have caved in to the whims of nationally blinkered governments.
Unfortunately, we have no brave and visionary Commission President.
Unfortunately, the Liberals and the Socialists in this House were not ready to fight with the Greens to make this recovery package a real first step to a green new deal.
Before change can happen in Europe we must change the President of the Commission.
In order to make this change happen, we need to change the majorities in the European Parliament.
‘ Stop Barroso – go for a green new deal ’: this is more than ever the right slogan for the upcoming European elections.
Mr President, I rise on Mr Hoppenstedt ’ s report to give the Budget Committee ’ s opinion.
Like Mr Hoppenstedt, this will be my last speech before this Chamber after 20 years.
The Budget Committee recognises the importance of these proposals and their urgency.
It is quite clear that some key EU policies will be undermined without proper financing and therefore we are happy to support the proposal.
However, we would point that this money is coming from the margin of heading 1a, so that will reduce the margin and therefore reduce the availability of funding for other projects which may be important in the future.
We should bear that in mind.
Secondly, we should also ensure that these organisations do not in any way become agencies because, if they did, they would of course be subject to the interinstitutional agreement on agencies.
Finally, we would not want the Budget Committee ’ s position to be in any way undermined by the rush for these proposals.
That is why the Budget Committee was happy to support Mr McCreevy ’ s proposal on Monday night about interim funding, so that we can ensure that proper financial procedures and a proper trialogue takes place on the financial implication of these proposals.
Mr President, after 15 years this will be my last speech in the European Parliament and I think there are few more important issues than the whole question of asylum and how European countries face this challenge.
There is no easy response to this issue either.
If there was, some country would have found it by now.
In reality, I would suggest that the only way to reduce the number of desperate people who seek refuge or asylum in a country other than their own is to address the root causes that force them to leave their homes and countries of origin.
That is why it is so important that we in the EU, and in all developed democratic countries, offer advice, help and support – including financial support – to those countries that are affected by war, internal violence, lack of human rights or discrimination.
Equally, we have to address the poverty around the world which contributes to migratory pressures.
We should never condemn people who are forced to seek asylum or refugee status.
Instead, we should offer sympathy and offer our support.
That is our challenge today.
Mr President, as the situation in Iran escalates and the violation of democracy also presents a danger to the stability of the whole region, we have to express our concern and condemnation – but declarations must not only be symbolic and empty.
Some European leaders are talking about new sanctions to be imposed on Iran, but a discussion is needed right now on the promotion of democracy at grass-root level in this country.
I am Polish, and we in Eastern Europe know how important these types of actions are for the establishment of democracy.
A promotion should be adapted to the political and economic situation in a given country, but previous EU experience in the promotion of democracy in North Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe
has to be reviewed and evaluated in order to see what should be done in Iran, what can be done in Iran and what is effective under given circumstances in this country.
I also want to remind you that, if the EU wants to be credible, it also has to undertake some measures in Moldova.
Soon we will face a new test – on 29 July – with the elections in Moldova.
The EU has to do everything it can to ensure free and fair democratic elections in this country.
It is not enough to talk about support for democracy: we in the European Parliament and European institutions have to be more active in that respect.
Mr President, I want to raise the case of Mr John Zafiropoulos, who is in prison in Greece.
His family, who are my constituents, are convinced of his innocence.
At the beginning of this year, I wrote to the Minister of Justice in Athens raising the case.
I did not get a reply, so in a one-minute speech here in May in this Hemicycle I raised the question.
Immediately after I had spoken, the Greek Permanent Representation rushed to my office and promised me an immediate reply from the Minister in person.
Four months later: nothing.
If the Greek Permanent Representation is listening to us now in the Hemicycle, I would like to express my surprise and dismay that nothing has happened.
Would they please get me a reply from the Minister and look at the case of Mr John Zafiropoulos again?
Mr President, as one of the rapporteurs on the FTA with South Korea and a strong FTA protagonist, I am hoping for a balanced and level-playing-field agreement that benefits both sides – a true win-win situation.
One of our core industries is not really happy with the current status of negotiations, and they have many friends in their camp, including some Member States, industries and MEPs.
They all see the playing field unfairly tilted to benefit South Korea in this agreement.
The European Commission and the European Council should look hard into areas of friction, namely the DDB safeguard clause, non-tariff barriers and rules of origin.
If some progress could be achieved to bring more satisfaction to the EU car industry, then employment levels, strong GDP and expected standards of living would really benefit and be preserved.
However, a level playing field will not be a disadvantage.
A strong precedent may be established for other FTAs waiting in line and coming up soon in the near future.
It is clear to me that this agreement overall brings other benefits to the EU and to some of the EU ’ s different industries.
In the small picture, there will always be some winners and losers: it is the nature of any bilateral agreement.
In the big picture, we could be close to real balance.
However, with such a crucial industry as the automobile industry in a fairly unhappy mode, there is a need to try for more.
Only when achieving some additional progress can we speak of a truly balanced FTA that is acceptable and has a real and positive impact as a precedent for future FTAs.
Madam President, the liberalisation of the visa regime for the Western Balkan countries is important, as this measure matters most to ordinary citizens in the region and it will clearly show the benefits of the EU rapprochement process.
I am confident that the conditional inclusion on the white list of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina will prove to be a strong incentive for meeting the rest of the benchmarks on the road map.
In our case, back in 2001, such a strong signal was sent, and in a couple of months, we managed to fulfil all pending conditions.
It is essential that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina are included on the Schengen white list as soon as possible, and the Commission should provide all the necessary technical assistance to the authorities of these two countries in order to meet the necessary conditions in a short while.
Mr President, so far the G20 has concentrated on measures for the financial sector.
However, everyone seems to forget that the real economy also suffers from greed and an obsession with short-term profits.
I have deep respect for small enterprises which, against all odds, try to survive.
They deserve to get the loans to which they are entitled.
However, I have no respect at all for the management of some of the bigger companies which have no affinity with the products or services they deliver and can only think in terms of expansion and speculation.
I therefore call upon the G20 to discuss ways of making the economy more democratic and how to make sure that, within the company, workers and others who represent the general interest have enough power to control the management.
Within the EU, we have to look again at the statute for a European company.
We should make sure that it becomes impossible for shareholders and management to engage in speculative growth strategies to the detriment of the long-term interest of the companies themselves and of those who work for these companies.
Mr President, the majority of Europeans are not corporate leaders and not bankers but family farmers, small entrepreneurs, state employees.
The majority of Europe is completely fed up with the present system, in which global multinational corporations and banks rule the world.
They need, and they want, a fundamentally new paradigm, in which there must be a shift from globalisation to localisation, from completely profit- and
money-centred decision making to human-centred and community-centred decision making, from WTO-ruled free trade agriculture to food sovereignty, local production and local farming.
Please do not fail to represent at the G20 Summit the views of the majority of Europe.
Mr President, I voted in favour because the issue of energy supply security is of paramount importance today for all Member States of the European Union.
