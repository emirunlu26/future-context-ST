10000.0000 0 5480  Mr President, the Parliament defends individuals and small organisations, small
11000.0000 5480 10100  businesses, as opposed to governments who want to sweep away inconvenient things.
16000.0000 10580 14540  And the Internal Market Committee feels very strongly that the external
17000.0000 14560 16040  land border shops
18000.0000 16040 17140  should be allowed
18080.0000 17120 17820  to remain.
